After installing [NPM](http://npmjs.org "NPM") and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org "NodeJS"), you type the following command : `npm install`.

When the packages are all installed, type this : `node app.js`, the application will run, and all the generated HTML files will be found at the folder /results.

ENJOY !
