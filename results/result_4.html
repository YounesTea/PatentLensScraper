		The present invention relates to a memory element and a semiconductor device that includes the memory element.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0002"></a>[0002]</span>&#160;
		In recent years, development of a semiconductor device in which a plurality of circuits are integrated together over an insulating surface and that has a variety of functions has been progressing. In addition, development of a semiconductor device in which electromagnetic waves received by an antenna provided in the semiconductor device are converted into electrical energy and transmission and reception of data is performed using this electrical energy has been progressing. This kind of semiconductor device is referred to as a wireless chip (also referred to as an ID tag, an IC tag, an IC chip, an RF (radio frequency) tag, a wireless tag, an electronic tag, and <span class="highlightable highlight">RFID</span> (radio frequency identification) and has already been introduced into a part of the marketplace.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0003"></a>[0003]</span>&#160;
		Currently, many of these semiconductor devices that have been put into practical use have a circuit (also called an IC (integrated circuit) chip) formed using a semiconductor substrate of silicon or the like and have an antenna. In addition, the IC chip is formed of a memory circuit, a control circuit, and the like. In particular, by provision of a memory circuit with which a lot of data can be stored, an even more highly functional semiconductor device with an even higher added value can be provided. However, even though silicon substrates are expensive, manufacturing these semiconductor devices at low cost is demanded. This is because of an expectation that small semiconductor devices like a wireless chip will need to be semi-disposable. Given this, in recent years, development of organic devices, for example, organic thin film transistors (hereinafter also referred to as organic TFTs), organic memory devices, and the like, in which a control circuit and a memory circuit are formed over a low-cost glass substrate and, furthermore, the control circuit and memory circuit can be formed using an organic compound formed at low temperature, is actively being carried out (for an example, refer to Patent Document 1: Japanese Published Patent Application <a shape="rect" name="pcit0001">2002-26277</a>).<br clear="none"><br>

<a shape="rect" name="pcit0002">WO2006/059746</a> describes a memory element comprising a first conductive layer, a layer containing a metal oxide and an organic compound material, an organic compound layer and a second conductive layer sequentially over a substrate.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0004"></a>[0004]</span>&#160;
		A memory element that functions as a memory portion of an organic memory device is formed by the provision of an organic compound layer between a pair of electrodes; writing of data (programming) is performed using changes in the electrical characteristics, such as a change in the resistance, by application of a voltage between the electrodes. Although the principle of this kind of operation is quite simple, even in memory elements with the same structure, variations in writing behavior from element to element are easily generated. For example, the results of an examination of variations in writing voltage from memory element to memory element (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.,</span> distribution of the programming voltage) in which a first conductive layer, an organic compound layer, and a second conductive layer are stacked, in order, will be described below. The dimensions of the memory elements used are 5 &#181;m by 5 &#181;m (hereinafter, expressed as (5 &#181;m)<sup>2</sup>) and 10 &#181;m by 10 &#181;m (hereinafter, expressed as (10 &#181;m)<sup>2</sup>). For the first conductive layer, titanium at a film thickness of 100 nm is used; for the organic compound layer, 4,4'-bis[<span style="font-style:italic">N-</span>(1-naphthyl)-<span style="font-style:italic">N</span>-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviated designation: NPB) at a film thickness of 10 nm is used; and for the second conductive layer, aluminum at a film thickness of 200 nm is used.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0005"></a>[0005]</span>&#160;
		In the present experiment, a memory device formed of 64 memory elements, that is, a 64-bit memory device, was used. The accumulated programming ratio with respect to applied voltage is shown in FIG. 23.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0006"></a>[0006]</span>&#160;
		From FIG. 23, in a memory device of whichever size, there are variations in the writing voltage of the memory element from element to element. As a result, a large difference is generated between the voltage when writing begins (in FIG. 23, 5 V) and the voltage when writing is completed (in FIG. 23, from 10 V to 15 V). In this type of case, because there is a need to set the writing voltage so that it matches the highest writing voltage required by the memory element, power consumption is increased. This means that the variations from pixel to pixel lead to an increase in power consumption.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0007"></a>[0007]</span>&#160;
		In consideration of the aforementioned problem, the object of the present invention is to reduce variations in programming behavior of memory elements with motivation of producing a memory device and a semiconductor device equipped with the memory device having excellent writing characteristics.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0008"></a>[0008]</span>&#160;
		One aspect of the present invention is a memory element according to claim 1.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0009"></a>[0009]</span>&#160;
		In the above structures, the semiconductor layers may be discontinuous layers.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0010"></a>[0010]</span>&#160;
		Furthermore, in the above structures, the metal oxide layer may be formed of an oxide material used in the first conductive layer. In this case, the metal oxide layer may be formed by oxidation of the surface of the first conductive layer. Oxidation processes include natural oxidation and the like, in addition to plasma treatment or heat treatment in the presence of oxygen.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0011"></a>[0011]</span>&#160;
		In addition, in the above memory elements, the organic compound layers may each also have an insulator.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0012"></a>[0012]</span>&#160;
		The organic compound layer of the memory element of the present invention is formed using an electron-transporting material or a hole-transporting material. Electrical characteristics of the memory elements are changed and writing of data is performed by application of a voltage. Electrical characteristics include, for example, resistance; while data is being written, a part of the first conductive layer and a part of the second conductive layer acting as a pair are connected, that is, short-circuited (hereinafter, also referred to as shorted). With this, a change in the amount of resistance occurs.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0013"></a>[0013]</span>&#160;
		In addition, another aspect of the present invention is a semiconductor device in which a plurality of the memory elements is arranged in matrix. It is to be noted that each one of the plurality of the memory elements may be connected to a thin film transistor.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0014"></a>[0014]</span>&#160;
		The abovementioned semiconductor device may include a third conductive layer that functions as an antenna and that is electrically connected to a memory element through a circuit.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0015"></a>[0015]</span>&#160;
		There are no particular limitations on the level of the writing voltage as long as it is a voltage by which electrical characteristics of a memory element can be changed by application of the voltage between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer. The applied voltage needed to substantially change the electrical characteristics of this memory element is designated as the writing voltage in the present specification. Writing of data is performed in this way using changes in the electrical characteristics of the memory element by application of a voltage. In addition, for the reading voltage, an applied voltage is used to read the difference between the electrical characteristics of an element to which data has been written and the electrical characteristics of an element to which data has not been written; however, there are no particular limitations on the level of the voltage at which electrical characteristics are not changed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0016"></a>[0016]</span>&#160;
		Moreover, in the present specification, the first conductive layer and second conductive layer are also referred to as electrodes.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0017"></a>[0017]</span>&#160;
		By the present invention, memory elements in which variations in programming behavior from memory element to memory element can be reduced and that have excellent writing characteristics as well as a memory device that includes the memory elements and a semiconductor device equipped with the memory device can be obtained.<br clear="none"><br>

		Next, an operation mechanism of the memory element will be described using FIGS. 16A to 16C. First, a drawing showing the memory element before voltage is applied is shown in FIG 16A. When voltage is applied between the first conductive layer 110 and the second conductive layer 114, carriers are injected into the semiconductor layer 112 and the organic compound layer 113 from the first conductive layer 110 through the metal oxide layer 111; at the time when the applied voltage reaches a certain value, the organic compound layer 113 is transformed. Herewith, at least a part of the second conductive layer 114 comes into contact with the semiconductor layer 112 and the first conductive layer 110, and as a result, the memory element is short-circuited (refer to reference numeral 160 in FIGS. 16B and 16C).

		In FIG. 5B, first, the first conductive layer 110 is formed over the substrate 521 using an evaporation method, a sputtering method, a CVD method, a printing method, an electroplating method, an electroless plating method, a droplet discharge method, or the like. Next, the metal oxide layer 111 is formed over the first conductive layer 110 by oxidation of the first conductive layer 110 by plasma treatment, heat treatment, or the like in the presence of oxygen. The metal oxide layer 111 may be formed by natural oxidation of the first conductive layer 110, as well. Of course, the metal oxide layer 111 may be formed by oxidation of a metal film formed separately from the first conductive layer 110. Alternatively, a metal oxide layer may be directly formed over the first conductive layer 110 by evaporation or sputtering of the metal oxide, or by application or droplet discharge of a solution or dispersion of the metal oxide. The metal oxide layer may also be formed by a sol-gel technique using a metal alkoxide. Next, over the metal oxide layer 111, the semiconductor layer 112 and the organic compound layer 113 are formed, in order, using an evaporation method, an electron-beam deposition method, a sputtering method, a CVD method, or the like. Moreover, for additional formation methods, a spin coating method, a sol-gel method, a printing method, a droplet discharge method, or the like may be used, or any of these methods may be combined with any of the above methods. Furthermore, the second conductive layer 114 is formed over the organic compound layer 113 using an evaporation method, a sputtering method, a CVD method, a printing method, or a droplet discharge method.

		In addition, when there is concern about current leakage to neighboring memory elements, in order to separate the organic compound layer provided in each memory element from organic compound layers in other memory elements, a partition wall (an insulating layer) may be provided between the organic compound layers formed in neighboring memory elements. That is, the organic compound layer in each memory element may be electrically separated from those of other memory elements.<br clear="none"><br>

		 In addition, as shown in FIG. 6B, a partition wall (an insulating layer) 621 may be provided between the first conductive layers 110 of neighboring memory elements 401. Herewith, not only can current leakage to neighboring memory elements be prevented, but the discontinuity of these layers that results from differences in the height of the first conductive layer 110 on provision of the semiconductor layer 112 and organic compound layer 113 covering the first conductive layer 110 and the metal oxide layer 111 can be prevented, as well. It is to be noted that, in a cross section of a partition wall (insulating layer) 621, it is preferable that the side surfaces of the partition wall (insulating layer) 621 each be inclined at an angle of inclination greater than or equal to 10&#176; and less than 60&#176;, more preferably, greater than or equal to 25&#176; and less than or equal to 45&#176;, with respect to the surface of the first conductive layer 110. Moreover, curvature is preferable. After the partition wall (insulating layer) 621 is formed in this way, the semiconductor layer 112, the organic compound layer 113, and the second conductive layer 114 are formed so as to cover the metal oxide layer 111 and the partition wall (insulating layer) 621. The metal oxide layer 111 can be formed by oxidation of the surface of the first conductive layer 110 as described above. It is to be noted that the metal oxide layer 111 may be formed by oxidation of the surface of the first conductive layer 110 using plasma treatment in the presence of oxygen, for example, a resist ashing step or the like, included in the step for forming the partition wall (insulating layer) 621. Of course, the metal oxide layer may be formed by oxidation by heat treatment or by natural oxidation or formed by oxidation of a metal film formed separately, as well. In addition, the present invention is not limited to the structure described above, and the partition wall (insulating layer) 621 may be formed after the metal oxide layer 111 is formed over the first conductive layer 110 or after the metal oxide layer 111 and the semiconductor layer 112 are formed over the first conductive layer 110.<br clear="none"><br>

		Next, an operation for writing of data to the memory element (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.,</span> programming operation) will be described. Here, the case for when writing of data is performed by an electrical operation , typically, by application of a voltage, will be described using FIGS. 4A to 4C. It is to be noted that writing is performed by changes in the electrical characteristics of the memory element; the initial state (a state in which an electrical operation has not been performed) of the memory element is set to be data of [0], and the state in which the electrical characteristics have been changed is set to be data of [1]<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0069"></a>[0069]</span>&#160;
		When data of [1] is written to each memory element 401, first, the memory element 401 is selected by the decoders 412 and 413 and the selector 414. Specifically, a given potential V2 is applied to a word line W3 connected to the memory element 401 by the decoder 413. In addition, a bit line B3 connected to the memory element 401 is connected to the reading/writing circuit 415 by the decoder 412 and the selector 414. Then, a writing potential V1 is output to the bit line B3 by the reading/writing circuit 415. In this way, a voltage Vw = V1 - V2 is applied between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer included in the memory element 401. By selection of a suitable voltage for the voltage Vw, properties of a layer that contains an organic compound and is provided between the conductive layers are changed physically or electrically, and writing of data of [1] is performed. Specifically, for the voltage of the reading operation, the electrical resistance between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer for the state of data of [1], is changed so as to be dramatically decreased compared to the electrical resistance for the state of data of [0]; for example, the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer may be short-circuited (shorted out). It is to be noted that the potentials V1 and V2 should be selected, as suitable, from the range of (V1, V2) = (0 V, from 5 V to 15 V) or (V1, V2) = (from 3 V to 5 V, from -12 V to -2 V). The voltage V2 may be greater than or equal to 5 V and less than or equal to 15 V or greater than or equal to -15 V and less than or equal to -5 V<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0070"></a>[0070]</span>&#160;
		Non-selected word lines and non-selected bit lines are controlled so that data of [1] is not written to memory elements connected to the non-selected word lines and non-selected bit lines. For example, the non-selected word lines and non-selected bit lines may each be placed in a floating state.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0071"></a>[0071]</span>&#160;
		On the other hand, when data of [0] is written to the memory cell 401, an electrical operation is not to be performed on the memory element 401. For the circuit operation, for example, similar to when data of [1] is written, the memory element 401 is selected by the decoders 412 and 413 and the selector 414; however, an output potential output from the reading/writing circuit 415 to the bit line B3 may be set to be equivalent to the potential of the selected word line W3 or the potential of unselected word lines, and a voltage (for example, greater than or equal to -5 V and less than or equal to 5 V) of a level of which the electrical characteristics of the memory element 401 do not change may be applied between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer included in the memory element 401.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0072"></a>[0072]</span>&#160;
		 Subsequently, an operation performed for reading of data from the memory element is performed will be described using FIG 4B. Reading of data is performed using the difference in electrical characteristics between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer for a memory element with data of [0] and for a memory element with data of [1]. For example, a reading method will be explained that uses the difference in electrical resistance where the effective electrical resistance between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer of the memory element with data of [0] (hereinafter, simply referred to as the electrical resistance of the memory element) is defined as R0 at the reading voltage and the electrical resistance of the memory element with data of [1] is defined as R1 at the reading voltage. It is to be noted that R1 is set to be much less than R0, or R1 &lt;&lt; R0. For the reading/writing circuit 415, in the structure of the reading portion, for example, the circuit shown in FIG 4B that has a resistor 450 and a differential amplifier 451 can be used. The resistor 450 has a resistance of Rr, where R1 &lt; Rr &lt; R0. In addition, as shown in FIG 4C, in exchange for the resistor 450, a transistor 452 may be used, and a clocked inverter 453 can be used in exchange for the differential amplifier 451. In the clocked inverter 453, when reading is performed, the voltage comes to be High, when reading is not performed, the voltage comes to be Low, and a signal &#934; or an inverse signal thereof is input, accordingly. Of course, the circuit structure is not limited to those shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0073"></a>[0073]</span>&#160;
		When reading of data from a memory element 402 is performed, first, the memory element 402 is selected by the decoders 412 and 413 and the selector 414. Specifically, a predetermined potential Vy is applied to a word line Wy, which is connected to the memory element 402, by the decoder 413. In addition, a bit line Bx connected to the memory element 402 is connected to a terminal P of the reading/writing circuit 415 by the decoder 412 and the selector 414. As a result, a potential Vp of the terminal P comes to be a value determined by resistor divider where the resistance of the resistor 450 (resistance of Rr) and the memory element 402 (resistance of R0 or R1) are determined by Vy and V0. Accordingly, when the memory element 402 has data of [0], a potential Vp0 of the terminal P becomes Vp0 = Vy + (V0-Vy) &#215; R0/(R0+Rr). Furthermore, when the memory element 402 has data of [1], a potential Vp1 of the terminal P becomes Vp1 = Vy + (V0-Vy) &#215; R1/(R1+Rr). As a result, in FIG. 4B, by selection of a Vref whose value falls between Vp0 and Vp1, or by selection of a point of change of the clocked inverter 453 in FIG 4C that comes to be between Vp0 and Vp1, an output potential Vout outputs Low/High (or High/Low) in response to data of [0]/[1], and reading can be performed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0074"></a>[0074]</span>&#160;
		For example, the differential amplifier 451 operates at Vdd = 3 V, and the following are set: Vy = 0 V, V0 = 3 V, and Vref = 1.5 V. Assuming that R0/Rr = Rr/R1 = 9, when the data of the memory element is [0], Vp0 becomes 2.7 V, Vp0 = 2.7 V, and Vout is output as a High; when the data of the memory element is [1], Vp1 becomes 0.3 V, Vp1 = 0.3 V, and Vout is output as a Low. In this way, reading of data of the memory element can be performed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0075"></a>[0075]</span>&#160;
		By the above method, for the state of the electrical resistance of the layer that contains an organic compound, the amount of voltage is read using the difference in resistance and by resistor divider. Of course, the reading method is not limited to this method. For example, other than use of the difference in resistance, reading may be performed using the difference in current. Alternatively, when the electrical characteristics of the memory cell include diode characteristics in which the threshold voltage varies for data of "0" and for data of "1," reading of data may be performed using the difference in threshold voltages.<br clear="none"><br>

		In the semiconductor device presented in the present embodiment mode, by use of memory elements of the present invention in the semiconductor device, variations in programming behavior from memory element to memory element can be reduced. For this reason, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be fabricated. In addition, an increase in writing voltage can be prevented, and the margin for reading voltage can be widened. Consequently, the amount of freedom in design of the semiconductor device can be increased.<br clear="none"><br>

		Furthermore, not only is data written to the semiconductor device just once, but additional data (appended data) can also be written to the semiconductor device while memory elements to which data has not been written still remain. On the other hand, because data cannot be erased once writing to the memory element has been performed, forgery due to rewriting of data can be prevented. Moreover, because the memory element of the present invention is one that has a simple structure in which a metal oxide layer, a semiconductor layer, and an organic compound layer are interposed between a pair of conductive layers, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be manufactured at low cost.<br clear="none"><br>

		In particular, it is preferable that a crystalline semiconductor crystallized by irradiation with a laser beam of an amorphous or microcrystalline semiconductor, a crystalline semiconductor crystallized by heat treatment, or a crystalline semiconductor crystallized by a combination of heat treatment and irradiation with a laser beam be applied. For heat treatment, a crystallization method can be applied that uses a metallic element such as nickel or the like that functions to promote crystallization of a silicon semiconductor.<br clear="none"><br>

		When crystallization is performed by irradiation with a laser beam, crystallization can be performed by irradiation with a continuous-wave laser beam or with an ultra-short pulsed laser beam with a high repetition rate of 10 MHz or more and a pulse width of 1 nanosecond or less, preferably, from 1 to 100 picoseconds, where a melting zone of a melted crystallized semiconductor is continuously moved in the direction of irradiation with the laser beam. By this kind of crystallization method, a crystallized semiconductor with a large grain size and in which crystal grain boundaries extend in a single direction can be obtained. By alignment of the direction of carrier drift with the direction along which these crystal grains extend, the electric field effect mobility of a transistor can be increased. For example, an electric field effect mobility of 400 cm<sup>2</sup>/(V&#183;s) can be achieved.<br clear="none"><br>

		When the above crystallization step is performed using a crystallization process in which a glass substrate is heated to a temperature less than or equal to the allowable temperature limit of the glass substrate (approximately 600 &#176;C), a glass substrate with a large area can be used. For this reason, a large number of semiconductor devices can be manufactured per substrate, and costs can be lowered.<br clear="none"><br>

		In addition, the semiconductor layer 902 may be formed by performance of a crystallization step in which heat treatment is performed at a temperature greater than or equal to the allowable temperature limit of the glass substrate using a substrate that can withstand the heating temperature. Typically, the semiconductor layer 902 is formed by heating of an amorphous or microcrystalline semiconductor at a temperature greater than or equal to 700 &#176;C using a quartz substrate over an insulating substrate. As a result, a semiconductor with a high crystallinity can be formed. In this case, because characteristics such as response speed, carrier mobility, and the like are favorable, a thin film transistor in which operations can be performed at high speed can be offered.<br clear="none"><br>

		The gate electrode 904 can be formed of a polycrystalline semiconductor that is doped with a metal or with an impurity of one conductivity type. When a metal is used, tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), tantalum (Ta), aluminum (Al), or the like can be used. In addition, a metal nitride obtained from the nitriding of a metal can also be used. Alternatively, the gate electrode 904 may also be formed as a stacked structure of a first layer formed of a metal nitride and a second layer formed of a metal. When the stacked structure is used, the structure may be formed as a so-called hat shape in which the edge of the first layer protrudes beyond the edge of the second layer. At this time, because the first layer is formed of a metal nitride, the first layer can be set to be a barrier metal. That is, diffusion of the metal of the second layer into the insulating layer 903 and the semiconductor layer 902 under the insulating layer 903 can be prevented.<br clear="none"><br>

		For transistor formed by combination of the semiconductor layer 902, the insulating layer 903, and the gate electrode 904, various structures, such as a single drain structure, an LDD (lightly doped drain) structure, a gate-overlapped drain structure, and the like can be applied. It is to be noted that, in FIG 9A, a thin film transistor with an LDD structure in which low-concentration impurity regions 909 are formed in a semiconductor layer superimposed by sidewalls is shown. Alternatively, a single-gate structure, a multi-gate structure in which a gate voltage of the same potential is applied equally to transistors connected in series, a dual-gate structure in which a semiconductor layer is sandwiched by gate electrodes above and below, or the like can also be applied.<br clear="none"><br>

		The insulating layer 821 is formed of an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, or the like or of an organic insulating material such as an acrylic resin, a polyimide resin, or the like. When a coating method such as a spin coating or roll coater method is used, an insulating layer formed of silicon oxide by heat treatment after an insulating film material dissolved in an organic solvent is applied can be used, as well. For example, an insulating layer that can be formed by heat treatment at a temperature of from 200 &#176;C to 400 &#176;C after a coating film that contains siloxane bonds is formed can be used. By formation of the insulating layer 821 as an insulating layer formed by a coating method or as an insulating layer flattened by a reflow method, disconnection of wirings formed over this layer can be prevented. Furthermore, when multi-layer wirings are formed, the above coating method can be used effectively.<br clear="none"><br>

Furthermore, over those layers, an insulating layer (not shown) that functions as a protective film may be provided. The wirings 907, each of which is connected to a source region or drain region of the semiconductor layer, can be formed over the insulating layer 905 or over the insulating layer 821.

		Furthermore, a memory element may be formed over a transistor that is formed using a single-crystal substrate or an SOI substrate. The SOI substrate may be formed using a method by wafer bonding or using a method called SIMOX in which an insulating layer 831 is formed inside an Si substrate by implantation of oxygen ions into the Si substrate.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0110"></a>[0110]</span>&#160;
		For example, when a single-crystal semiconductor is used for the substrate, as shown in FIG 8C, the memory element 801 is connected to the field effect transistor 832 provided using a single-crystal semiconductor substrate 830. Furthermore, an insulating layer 833 is formed so as to cover wirings of the field effect transistor 832, and the memory element 801 is formed over the insulating layer 833.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0111"></a>[0111]</span>&#160;
		Because characteristics, such as response speed, carrier mobility, and the like, of a transistor formed by this kind of single-crystal semiconductor substrate, are favorable, a thin film transistor in which operations can be performed at high speed can be offered.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0112"></a>[0112]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that the memory element 801 has a first conductive layer 110, a metal oxide layer 111, a semiconductor layer 112, an organic compound layer 113, and a second conductive layer 114, which are all provided over the insulating layer 833, with a structure in which the metal oxide layer 111, semiconductor layer 112, and organic compound layer 113 are interposed between the first conductive layer 110 and the second conductive layer 114. Note that the metal oxide layer 111 is provided in contact with the first conductive layer 110 and the semiconductor layer 112 is provided in contact with the metal oxide layer 111.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0113"></a>[0113]</span>&#160;
		In this way, by formation of the memory element 801 provided over the insulating layer 833, the first conductive layer 110 can be placed freely. That is, in the structure in FIG. 8B, the memory element needs to be formed in a region where the wirings connected to the transistor are not formed; however, by provision of the insulating layer 833, for example, as shown in FIG. 8C, the memory element 801 can be formed over the transistor 832. As a result, a memory circuit can be formed at an even higher level of integration. Of course, the wirings 907 included in the field effect transistor 832 may be used as the first conductive layer of the memory element.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0114"></a>[0114]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that, in the structures shown in FIGS. 8B and 8C, an example is shown in which the semiconductor layer 112 and organic compound layer 113 are formed over the entire surface of the substrate; however, these organic compound layers may be formed over each memory cell only. In this case, by selective formation of an organic compound layer by discharge and baking of an organic compound using a droplet discharge method or the like, the usage efficiency of the materials can be improved.<br clear="none"><br>

		In addition, after a peeling layer is formed over a substrate and a layer 1030 that includes a transistor and the memory element 801 are formed over the peeling layer, the layer 1030 that includes a transistor and the memory element 801 may be separated from the substrate using the peeling layer, and, as shown in FIG 10, the layer 1030 that includes a transistor and the memory element 801 may be bonded to a substrate 1031 that differs from the previous substrate by use of an adhesive layer 1032. For the separation method, any of the following methods may be used: (1) a method in which a metal oxide layer acting as the peeling layer is interposed between a substrate with high heat tolerance and the layer that includes a transistor, the metal oxide layer is made brittle by crystallization, and the layer that includes a transistor is separated from the substrate; (2) a method in which an amorphous silicon film that contains hydrogen is interposed between a substrate with high heat tolerance and the layer that includes a transistor, the amorphous silicon film is removed by irradiation with a laser beam or by etching, and the layer that includes a transistor is separated from the substrate; (3) a method in which a substrate with high heat tolerance over which the layer that includes a transistor is formed is eliminated mechanically or removed by etching with an etching solution, with NF<sub>3</sub> gas, or with a halogen fluoride gas such as BrF<sub>3</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, or the like; (4) a method in which a metal layer and a metal oxide layer acting as the peeling layer are interposed between a substrate with high heat tolerance and the layer that includes a transistor, and after the metal oxide layer is made brittle by crystallization or a part of the metal layer is removed by etching with an etching solution, with NF<sub>3</sub> gas, or with a halogen fluoride gas such as BrF<sub>3</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, or the like, the substrate and the layer that includes a transistor are physically separated from each other at the metal oxide layer that has been made brittle.<br clear="none"><br>

		Furthermore, for the substrate 1031, by use of the flexible substrate, film, paper formed of a fibrous material, or the like that are presented for the substrate 521 shown in Embodiment Mode 2, a reduction in the size, thickness, and weight of a memory device can be achieved.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0117"></a>[0117]</span>&#160;
		Next, an operation for writing of data to a memory device, that is, the semiconductor device 700, will be described using FIG. 7A. As in Embodiment Mode 2, an operation, here, an electrical operation, performed when data is written to the memory device, typically, performed by application of a voltage, will be described. It is to be noted that writing is performed by changing of the electrical characteristics of a memory cell; the initial state (a state in which an electrical operation is not applied) is defined as data of [0], and the state in which electrical characteristics have been changed is defined as data of [1].<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0118"></a>[0118]</span>&#160;
		A case when data is written to a memory cell 701 of the x<sup>th</sup> row and y<sup>th</sup> column is described. When data of [1] is written to the memory cell 701, first, the memory cell 701 is selected by the decoders 712 and 713 and the selector 714. Specifically, a given potential V22 is applied to the word line Wy connected to the memory cell 701 by the decoder 713. In addition, the reading/writing circuit 715 is connected to the bit line Bx connected to the memory cell 701 by the decoder 712 and the selector 714. A writing voltage V21 is output to the bit line Bx from the reading/writing circuit 715.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0119"></a>[0119]</span>&#160;
		 In this way, a thin film transistor 721 included in the memory cell 701 is placed in an on state, a common electrode and a bit line are electrically connected to the memory element 722, and a voltage roughly equal to Vw = Vcom - V21 is applied to the memory element 722. Vcom is the potential of a common electrode, that is, the second conductive layer, in the memory element 722. By selection of a suitable voltage for the voltage Vw, properties of a layer containing an organic compound that is provided between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer are changed physically or electrically, and writing of data of [1] is performed. Specifically, at the reading operation voltage, the electrical resistance between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer for the state of data of [1], compared to that of the state of data of [0], may be dramatically decreased, and the first conductive layer and second conductive layer may even be short-circuited (shorted). It is to be noted that the potential may be selected, as appropriate, from the ranges of (V21, V22, Vcom) = (from 5 V to 15 V, from 5 V to 15 V, 0 V) or (V21, V22, Vcom) = (from -12 V to 0 V, from -12 V to 0 V, from 3 V to 5 V). The voltage Vw may be set to be greater than or equal to 5 V and less than or equal to 15 V or to be greater than or equal to -15 V and less than or equal to -5 V.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0120"></a>[0120]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that non-selected word lines and non-selected bit lines are controlled so that data of [1] is not written to memory cells connected to those lines. Specifically, a potential that places a transistor of a memory cell connected to a non-selected word line into an off state may be applied, or a potential approximately equal to Vcom may be applied.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0121"></a>[0121]</span>&#160;
		 On the other hand, when data of [0] is written to the memory cell 701, an electrical operation need not be applied to the memory cell 701. For the circuit operation, for example, as for when data of [1] is written, the memory cell 701 is selected by the decoders 712 and 713 and the selector 714; however, an output potential output from the reading/writing circuit 715 to the bit line Bx may be set to be equivalent to Vcom or may be a potential that places the thin film transistor 721 of the memory cell into an off state. As a result, because either a low voltage (for example, a voltage from -5 V to 5 V) is applied or else no voltage is applied to the memory element 722, the electrical characteristics are not changed, and writing of data of [0] is realized.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0122"></a>[0122]</span>&#160;
		Subsequently, an operation performed for reading of data from the memory element by an electrical operation will be described using FIG. 7B. Reading of data is performed using the difference in electrical characteristics of the memory element 722 between a memory element with data of [0] and a memory element with data of [1]. For example, a reading method will be described that uses the difference in electrical resistance between that of the memory element included in the memory cell with data of [0] is defined as R0 at the reading voltage and the electrical resistance of the memory element included in the memory cell with data of [1] is defined as R1 at the reading voltage. It is to be noted that R1 is set to be much less than R0, or R1 &lt;&lt; R0. As the reading/writing circuit 715, for the structure of the reading portion, for example, the circuit shown in FIG. 7B that has a resistor 750 and a differential amplifier 751 can be used. The resistor 750 has a resistance Rr, where R1 &lt; Rr &lt; R0. In addition, in exchange for the resistor 750, as shown in FIG. 7C, a transistor 752 may be used, and a clocked inverter 753 can be used in exchange for the differential amplifier 751. Of course, the circuit structure is not limited to those shown in FIGS. 7B and 7C.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0123"></a>[0123]</span>&#160;
		When reading of data from a memory cell 702 of the x<sup>th</sup> row and y<sup>th</sup> column is performed, first, the memory cell 702 is selected by the decoders 712 and 713 and the selector 714. Specifically, a given potential V24 is applied to a word line Wy connected to the memory cell 702 by the decoder 713, and the thin film transistor 721 is placed in an on state. In addition, a bit line Bx connected to the memory cell 702 is connected to a terminal P of the reading/writing circuit 715 by the decoder 712 and the selector 714. As a result, a potential Vp of the terminal P comes to be a value determined by resistor divider where the resistance of the resistor 450 (resistance of Rr) and the memory element 402 (resistance of R0 or R1) are determined by Vy and V0. Accordingly, a potential Vp0 of the terminal P when the memory cell 702 has data of [0] becomes Vp0 = Vcom + (V0-Vcom) &#215; R0/(R0+Rr). Furthermore, the potential Vp1 of the terminal P when the memory cell 702 has data of [1] becomes Vp1 = Vcom + (V0-Vcom) &#215; R1/(R1+Rr). As a result, in FIG 7B, by selection of a Vref whose value falls between Vp0 and Vp1, or by selection of a point of change of the clocked inverter in FIG. 7C that comes to be between Vp0 and Vp1, Low/High (or High/Low) is output as an output potential Vout in response to data of [0]/[1], and reading can be performed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0124"></a>[0124]</span>&#160;
		For example, the differential amplifier 751 operates at Vdd = 3 V, and the following are set: Vcom = 0 V, V0 = 3 V, and Vref = 1.5 V. Assuming that R0/Rr = Rr/R1 = 9, if the on resistance of the thin film transistor 721 can be ignored, when the data of the memory cell is [0], Vp0 becomes 2.7 V, Vp0 = 2.7 V, and a High is output for Vout; when the data of the memory cell is [1], Vp1 becomes 0.3 V, Vp1 = 0.3 V, and a Low is output for Vout. In this way, reading of the memory cell can be performed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0125"></a>[0125]</span>&#160;
		By the above method, the amount of voltage is read using differences in the resistance of the memory element 722 and resistance division. Of course, the reading method is not limited to this method. For example, other than use of the difference in resistance, reading may be performed using the difference in current. Alternatively, when the electrical characteristics of the memory cell include diode characteristics in which the threshold voltage varies for data of "0" and for data of "1," reading may be performed using the difference in threshold voltages.<br clear="none"><br>

		In addition, a memory element or memory element array may be formed over a thin film transistor (TFT) that is formed over an insulating substrate, or the memory element or memory element array may be formed over a field effect transistor (FET) formed on a semiconductor substrate of Si or the like or an SOI substrate used instead of the substrate that has an insulator.<br clear="none"><br>

		The semiconductor device presented in the present embodiment mode is one in which, by memory elements of the present invention being included in the semiconductor device, variations in programming behavior from memory element to memory element can be reduced. For this reason, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be fabricated. In addition, an increase in writing voltage can be prevented, and the margin for the reading voltage can be widened. Consequently, the amount of freedom in design of the semiconductor device can be increased.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0128"></a>[0128]</span>&#160;
		Furthermore, not only is data written to the semiconductor device just once, but additional data (appended data) can be written to the semiconductor device while memory elements to which data has not been written still remain. On the other hand, because data cannot be erased once writing to the memory element has been performed, forgery due to rewriting of data can be prevented. Moreover, because the memory element of the present invention is one that has a simple structure in which a metal oxide layer, a semiconductor layer, and an organic compound layer are interposed between a pair of conductive layers, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be manufactured at low cost.<br clear="none"><br>

		A semiconductor device shown in the present embodiment mode is one in which data can be read and written wirelessly. The data transmission format is roughly divided into the following three methods: an electromagnetic coupling method in which a pair of coils are placed facing each other and communication is performed by mutual induction, an electromagnetic induction method in which communication is performed by induction field, and an electromagnetic wave method in which communication is performed using electromagnetic waves, and any of the three methods may be used. In addition, there are two ways for providing an antenna used for transmission and reception of data: one way is to provide an antenna over a substrate over which a transistor and memory element are formed, and the other way is to provide a terminal portion over a substrate over which a transistor and memory element are provided and connecting an antenna provided over a separate substrate to the terminal portion.<br clear="none"><br>

		The memory circuit 16 includes one or a plurality of memory elements selected from a memory element presented in Embodiment Mode 1. By a memory element of the present invention being included, variations in programming behavior from memory element to memory element can be reduced. For this reason, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be fabricated. In addition, an increase in writing voltage can be prevented, and the margin for reading voltage can be widened. Consequently, the amount of freedom in design of the semiconductor device can be increased.<br clear="none"><br>

		In FIG. 12A, a semiconductor device that has a passive matrix memory circuit is shown. The semiconductor device has a layer 1351 that includes transistors 1300 and 1301 over a substrate 1350 and a memory element portion 1352 and a conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna over the layer 1351 that includes the transistors.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0142"></a>[0142]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that, here, a case is shown in which the memory element portion 1352 and conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna are formed over the layer 1351 that includes the transistors; however, the structure of the present invention is not limited to this structure, and the memory element portion 1352 or the conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna may be included under the layer 1351 that includes the transistors or in the same layer as the layer 1351 that includes the transistors.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0143"></a>[0143]</span>&#160;
		The memory element portion 1352 has a plurality of memory elements 1352a and 1352b. The memory element 1352a has a first conductive layer 110 formed over an insulating layer 1252, a metal oxide layer 111a formed using the first conductive layer 110, a semiconductor layer 112a formed to cover a portion of the first conductive layer 110 with the metal oxide layer 111a interposed between the semiconductor layer 112a and the first conductive layer 110, and an organic compound layer 113a and a second conductive layer 114a to further cover the semiconductor layer 112a. In addition, the memory element 1352b has a first conductive layer 110, a metal oxide layer 111b formed using the first conductive layer 110, a semiconductor layer 112b formed to cover a portion of the first conductive layer 110 with the metal oxide layer 111b interposed between the semiconductor layer 112b and the first conductive layer 110, and an organic compound layer 113b and a second conductive layer 114b to further cover the semiconductor layer 112b. The metal oxide layers 111a and 111b may also be formed by oxidation of a metal film formed separately from the first conductive layer 110. It is to be noted that individual memory elements 1352a and 1352b are separated from each other by partition walls (an insulating layer) 1374.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0144"></a>[0144]</span>&#160;
		The first conductive layer 110 in the memory element portion 1352 is connected to a wiring of the transistor 1301, and the memory element portion 1352 can be formed using materials and a method similar to the materials and method used to form the memory elements of the above embodiment modes. Furthermore, an insulating layer 522 that functions as a protective film is formed to cover the second conductive layers 114a and 114b and the conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0145"></a>[0145]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that the conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna is formed over a conductive layer 1360. The conductive layer 1360 is connected to the transistor 1300 by a wiring 1310 formed in the same step in which the first conductive layer 110 of the memory element portion 1352 is formed. In addition, the conductive layer that functions as an antenna may be formed of the same layer as the second conductive layers 114a and 114b.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0146"></a>[0146]</span>&#160;
		The conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna is formed of a conductive material using a CVD method; a sputtering method; a printing method such as a screen printing method, a gravure printing method, or the like; a droplet discharge method; a dispenser method; a plating method; or the like. The conductive material is formed of an element selected from aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), tantalum (Ta), or molybdenum (Mo) or an alloy material or compound material with one or more of these elements as the main component, as a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0147"></a>[0147]</span>&#160;
		For example, when the conductive layer that functions as an antenna is formed using a screen printing method, the conductive layer that functions as an antenna can be formed by printing of a conductive paste, in which conductive particles each with a grain size of from several nanometers to several tens of micrometers are dissolved in or dispersed throughout an organic resin, onto the desired region selectively. For the conductive particles, fine particles or dispersible nanoparticles of a metal such as any one or more of silver (Ag), gold (Au), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), or the like; or of a silver halide can be used. For the organic resin contained in the conductive paste, organic resins, each functioning as a binder, a solvent, a dispersant, or a coating material of a metal particle, can be used. Typically, an organic resin such as an epoxy resin, a silicone resin, and the like can be given. Moreover, at the formation of the conductive layer, it is preferable that the conductive paste be baked after having been extruded out. For example, when fine particles (with a particle diameter, for example, greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm) containing silver as the main component are used for the material of the conductive paste, by baking at a temperature in the range of from 150 &#176;C to 300 &#176;C, a cured conductive layer can be obtained. Alternatively, fine particles containing solder or lead-free solder as the main component may also be used; in this case, using fine particles with a particle diameter less than or equal to 20 &#181;m is preferable. Solder and lead-free solder have an advantage in being low cost. Furthermore, in addition to the above materials, a ceramic, ferrite, or the like may also be applied for the antenna.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0148"></a>[0148]</span>&#160;

		Moreover, a peeling layer is formed over the substrate; the layer 1351 that contains the transistors, the memory element portion 1352, and the conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna are formed over the peeling layer; the layer 1351 that contains the transistors, the memory element portion 1352, and the conductive layer 1353 that functions as an antenna are separated from the substrate using an appropriate separation method of the separation methods given in Embodiment Mode 3 and may be attached to a substrate by an adhesive. For the substrate, by use of the flexible substrate, film, paper formed of a fibrous material, a base film, or the like that are given for the substrate 521 shown in Embodiment Mode 2, a reduction in size, thickness, and weight of a memory device can be achieved.<br clear="none"><br>

		The first conductive layer 110d is connected to a wiring layer of the transistor 1441. On the other hand, the second conductive layer 114 is connected to a conductive layer 1457c stacked over a wiring layer 1456a. Furthermore, a conductive layer 1457 and the antenna 1431 shown in FIG. 14A are stacked and provided over the insulating layer 1455. In FIG 14B, the above conductive layer is formed as a conductive layer 1457a, a conductive layer 1457b, a conductive layer 1457e, and a conductive layer 1457f, where the conductive layer 1457a and an antenna 1431a, the conductive layer 1457b and an antenna 1431b, and the conductive layer 1457f and an antenna 1431d are each stacked together. It is to be noted that the conductive layer 1457e and an antenna 1431c are formed in an opening reaching to a wiring layer 1456b formed in the insulating layer 1455, and the conductive layer 1457e and the wiring layer 1456b are connected to each other. In this way, the antenna, the memory element portion 1404, and the circuit portion 1421 are connected electrically. Furthermore, the conductive layer 1457a, the conductive layer 1457b, the conductive layer 1457e, and the conductive layer 1457f formed under the antenna 1431a, the antenna 1431b, the antenna 1431c, and the antenna 1431d, respectively, each have an effect of improving the adhesiveness of the insulating layer 1455 and the antenna. In the present embodiment mode, a polyimide film for the insulating layer 1455; titanium films for the conductive layer 1457a, the conductive layer 1457b, the conductive layer 1457e, and the conductive layer 1457f; and aluminum films for the antenna 1431a, the antenna 1431b, the antenna 1431c, and the antenna 1431d are all used.<br clear="none"><br>

		It is to be noted that openings (also called contact holes) are formed in the insulating layer 1455 to connect the first conductive layer 110d and transistor 1441, the conductive layer 1457c and wiring layer 1456a, and the conductive layer 1457e and wiring layer 1456b to each other. Because a lower resistance results from an increase in the size of an opening and an increase in the area of the amount of which conductive layers come into contact with each other, in the present embodiment mode, the sizes of openings are set to increase, in order, so that an opening connecting the first conductive layer 110d and the transistor 1441 is the smallest, an opening connecting the conductive layer 1457c and the wiring layer 1456a is the next largest, and an opening connecting the conductive layer 1457e and the wiring layer 1456b is the largest.

		By use of a semiconductor device like the one above, a power supply voltage and signals are input from an external input portion into the memory element portion 1404 directly, whereby writing of data (which corresponds to information) to or reading of data from the memory element portion 1404 becomes possible.<br clear="none"><br>

		In addition, with respect to the memory element portion, the antenna may be formed as a structure that overlaps with the memory element portion or as a structure that does not overlap with the memory element portion but is formed in the periphery thereof. Furthermore, when the antenna is formed to overlap with the memory element portion, the antenna may be formed as a structure that overlaps over the entire surface of the memory element portion or as a structure that overlaps with only a portion of the memory element portion. For example, with the structure as one in which the antenna portion and the memory element portion overlap with each other, due to effects of noise in the signals transmitted whenever the antenna is communicating with a device or of changes in the electromotive force or the like generated by electromagnetic induction, the number of operation defects of the semiconductor device can be decreased.<br clear="none"><br>

		In FIGS. 15A to 15D, examples are shown of a semiconductor device formed as a chip that has a conductive layer 1502 that functions as an antenna and a memory element portion 1503 formed over a substrate 1501.

		When a microwave method (for example, frequency in the UHF band (from 860 to 960 MHz), at the 2.45 GHz band, or the like) is applied for the method of transmission of signals in the semiconductor device, the configuration of the length or the like of a conductive layer that functions as an antenna may be set appropriately in consideration of the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves used for the transmission of signals. For example, the conductive layer that functions as an antenna can be formed into a linear shape (for example, as a dipole antenna (refer to FIG. 15A)), a planar shape (for example, as a patch antenna (refer to FIG. 15B)), a ribbon shape (refer to FIGS. 15C and 15D), or the like. Furthermore, the shape of the conductive layer that functions as an antenna is not limited to a linear shape but may be formed into a curved line or into a meandering shape in consideration of the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves, or the conductive layer may be formed as a combination of any of these shapes.<br clear="none"><br>

		Moreover, when an electromagnetic coupling method or electromagnetic induction method (for example, frequency at the 13.56 GHz band) is applied for the method of transmission of signals in the semiconductor device, because electromagnetic induction by changes in the magnetic field density is used, it is preferable that the conductive layer that functions as an antenna be formed into a circular shape (for example, as a loop antenna) or a spiral shape (for example, as a spiral antenna).<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0176"></a>[0176]</span>&#160;
		Moreover, when the electromagnetic coupling method or electromagnetic induction method is applied and the semiconductor device including an antenna is provided so as to come into contact with metal, an eddy current flows with changes in the magnetic field; by generation of a demagnetizing field by the eddy current, changes in the magnetic field are weakened, and the distance at which communication can be exchanged decreases. For that reason, it is preferable that a material with magnetic permeability be provided between the semiconductor device and the metal. By provision of a material with magnetic permeability between the semiconductor device and the metal, the eddy current can be suppressed, and the decrease in the distance at which communication can be exchanged can be suppressed. It is to be noted that, for the magnetic material, either ferrite or a metallic thin film, where each has a high magnetic permeability but little high frequency loss, can be used.<br clear="none"><br>

		Furthermore, when an antenna is provided, a semiconductor element such as a transistor or the like and the conductive layer that functions as an antenna may be provided over a single substrate by being directly built into the substrate; alternatively, after a semiconductor element and the conductive layer that functions as an antenna are formed over separate substrates, the substrates may be attached to each other so that the semiconductor element and the conductive layer that functions as an antenna are electrically connected to each other.<br clear="none"><br>

		Not only is data written to the semiconductor device just once, but additional data (appended data) can also be written to the semiconductor device while memory elements to which data has not been written still remain. On the other hand, because data cannot be erased once writing to the memory element has been performed, forgery due to rewriting of data can be prevented. In addition, reading and writing of data can be performed by non-contact. Moreover, because the memory element of the present invention is one that has a simple structure in which a metal oxide layer, a semiconductor layer, and an organic compound layer are interposed between a pair of conductive layers, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be manufactured at low cost.<br clear="none"><br>

		Next, one aspect of an electronic device in which the semiconductor device of the present invention is mounted will be described with reference to FIG. 18. The example given here of the electronic device is a cellular phone device that includes cases 1800 and 1806, a panel 1801, a housing 1802, a printed wiring board 1803, operation buttons 1804, and a battery 1805. The panel 1801 is incorporated into the housing 1802 detachably, and the housing 1802 is fitted to the printed wiring board 1803. The housing 1802 is matched to the panel 1801 incorporated into the electronic device, and the shape and measurements of the housing 1802 may be changed appropriately. A plurality of packaged semiconductor devices are mounted on the printed wiring board 1803, and the semiconductor device of the present invention can be used for one of these. Each of the plurality of semiconductor devices mounted on the printed wiring board 1803 functions as any of the following: a controller, a central processing unit (CPU), a memory, a power supply circuit, a speech processing circuit, a transmitting and receiving circuit, or the like.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0219"></a>[0219]</span>&#160;
		The panel 1801 is bonded to the printed wiring board 1803 through a bonding film 1808. The above panel 1801, housing 1802, and printed wiring board 1803, as well as the operation buttons 1804 and the battery 1805, are placed inside the cases 1800 and 1806.

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0220"></a>[0220]</span>&#160;
		As stated above, the semiconductor device of the present invention is small, thin, and light-weight; therefore, limited space inside the cases 1800 and 1806 of the electronic device can be used effectively. It is to be noted that the cases 1800 and 1806 show one example of the shape and outward appearance of a cellular phone, but the electronic device of the present invention can be configured in a variety of modes according to the functions and applications of the electronic device.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0221"></a>[0221]</span>&#160;
		It is to be noted that the memory element of the present invention has a first conductive layer, a metal oxide layer, a semiconductor layer, an organic compound layer, and a second conductive layer, where the semiconductor layer and the organic compound layer are interposed between the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer, the metal oxide layer is provided in contact with the first conductive layer, and the semiconductor layer is provided in contact with the metal oxide layer. By use of this kind of memory element, variations in programming behavior from memory element to memory element can be reduced. For this reason, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be fabricated. In addition, an increase in writing voltage can be prevented, and the margin for reading voltage can be widened. Consequently, the amount of freedom in design of the semiconductor device can be increased.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0222"></a>[0222]</span>&#160;
		Furthermore, not only is data written to the semiconductor device just once, but additional data (appended data) can also be written to the semiconductor device while memory elements to which data has not been written still remain. On the other hand, because data cannot be erased once writing to the memory element has been performed, forgery due to rewriting of data can be prevented. Moreover, because the memory element of the present invention is one that has a simple structure in which a metal oxide layer, a semiconductor layer, and an organic compound layer are interposed between a pair of conductive layers, a semiconductor device with excellent writing characteristics can be manufactured at low cost.<br clear="none"><br>
