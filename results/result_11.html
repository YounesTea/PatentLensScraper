<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0002"></a>[0002]</span>&#160;
		The invention further relates to an item provided with a physical object for performing the method and a software product comprising program code for implementing the method.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0003"></a>[0003]</span>&#160;
		Such a method is known from <a shape="rect" name="ncit0001">PAPPU, R.; RECHT, B.; TAYLOR, J.; GERSHENFELD, N.: "Physical One-Way Functions", Science, Volume 297, pages 2026-2030, September 20, 2002</a>. In the known method, a scattering module is irradiated by laser from various directions and with various wave lengths. The pattern of the scattered light is detected by a detector. The images generated by the detector are analyzed and characterized by a key that allows for distinguishing between the scattering patterns contained in the images of the detector. The known apparatus can be used for implementing an authentication protocol based on illumination-key pairs. During the enrollment stage, several illumination-key pairs are acquired at a trusted terminal. During the verification stage of the protocol, the server challenges the scattering module with a specific illumination and compares the key of the response with the known key. The scattering module is authenticated if the Hamming-distance between the actual key and the key measured previously is below a predefined threshold.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0004"></a>[0004]</span>&#160;
		One disadvantage of the known method is that a bulky and complicated measuring device is needed for executing the method.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0005"></a>[0005]</span>&#160;
		The known method deals with the concept of so-called unique physical objects, their security applications, and their practical implementation. By the term unique object, we understand a physical object that possesses measurable properties that cannot be reproduced or cloned in another physical object. Ideally, this security against reproduction should even hold against the original manufacturer of the object, a feature which dramatically increases the security properties of unique objects against fraud. It also distinguishes unique objects from any related approaches like the security features on banknotes, or holograms on EC cards, which can be manufactured en masse with the same properties.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0006"></a>[0006]</span>&#160;
		In the known method the unique object is a random distribution of optically active particles in a solid body matrix, for example a PMMA matrix. Due to incontrollable variations in a standard production process (e.g. solution - spin coating - hardening), the precise positions, orientations, etc. of the particles will differ for each fabricated object, and are practically impossible to clone or to reproduce. At the same time, said features (positions, orientation, etc.), can be efficiently determined by well-known optical measurement techniques.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0007"></a>[0007]</span>&#160;
		It has been known for some time that unique objects can be applied to a number of important security problems [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14]. Among them are the copy-safe labeling of banknotes, passports, branded products, bank cards and the like, and the creation of copy protected digital content such as CDs and DVDs. The general idea here is to attach a unique structure as an unreproducible marker or "label" to one of the named items in order to certify its validity or genuineness. Further cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures can be applied [14, 5, 12], which - perhaps surprisingly - allow to test the validity of a marker in an offline process, without the use of a central database.<br clear="none"><br>
Please note that apart from being scientifically challenging, the named applications have an extraordinary economic value: The World Economic Forum, Davos, estimates the worldwide damage through product piracy alone to be on the order of 450 billion Dollars, and similar figures have been published by the US Ministry of Trade and the European Union. Unique objects have also to be considered in connection with the labeling problem. The first who considered the application of unique objects in our sense to banknote labeling was probably D. Bauder in the early eighties [1].<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0008"></a>[0008]</span>&#160;
		After that, a number of publications from Microsoft Research [5, 7, 8, 4, 6] explored other possible physical realisations (including optical and radio wave implementations). They also made contributions on implementation issues and provided some first security analysis.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0009"></a>[0009]</span>&#160;
		Two further research highlights, which have both been published in the Nature magazine, include the use of highly complex DNA solutions as unforgeable markers [3], an approach which for some time even was realised in the marketplace [9], and the employment of the reflectivity of paper surfaces [2]. Another, very recent publication is [15].<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0010"></a>[0010]</span>&#160;
		Proceeding from this related art, the present invention seeks to provide simplified security methods and devices.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0011"></a>[0011]</span>&#160;
		This object is achieved by a method having the features of the independent claim. Advantageous embodiments and refinements are specified in claims dependent thereon.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0012"></a>[0012]</span>&#160;
		In one embodiment of the method, the response signal comprises a plurality of characteristic resonant optical modes with parameters depend on irregularities of the inner structure. Resonant optical modes generally result in significant and distinguishable features that depend also on irregularities of the inner structure. In comparison to the prior art devices, the characteristic of the response signal can thus be determined relatively easily and are particularly difficult to imitate or fake.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0013"></a>[0013]</span>&#160;
		In one embodiment, the characteristic of the response signal includes an actual value and/or the dependency on time and/or the dependency of the challenge signal of at least one parameter of the group comprising spatial distribution frequency, intensity, polarization, line width, Q-factor and direction of radiation. These physical quantities of a resonant optical mode can be determined relatively easy.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0014"></a>[0014]</span>&#160;
		In one further embodiment of the method a physical object with an inner structure is used that comprises a photonic crystal with a basic periodic structure that varies with irregularities smaller than the period of the basic periodic structure. In particular, the spatial distribution and the frequency distribution of the resonant optical modes of a photonic crystal can be easily detected with high accuracy.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0015"></a>[0015]</span>&#160;
		The method can also include the use of a physical object having an inner structure comprising an optical resonator. This resonator can be formed in a section of the photonic crystal whereas the periodic structure is interrupted. It is also possible to arrange a plurality of optical resonators within the physical structure such that the optical resonators form interacting cavities. Such a structure results also in characteristic resonant optical modes.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0016"></a>[0016]</span>&#160;
		The characteristic resonant optical mode may also arise from a plurality of randomly distributed region with induced light emission.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0017"></a>[0017]</span>&#160;
		The method is not restricted to photo luminescence but may also use any luminescence effect, wherein the characteristic of the response signal is determined based on a spatial resolution of at least two frequency components of the response signal.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0018"></a>[0018]</span>&#160;
		In particular, if single particles are involved in the luminescence the physical object can not be easily reproduced since the spatial distribution of the particles strongly depends on the fabrication process. Furthermore, the luminescence effect may also depend on the spacing between the particles. The characteristic of the response signal can therefore also be determined in the frequencies domain.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0019"></a>[0019]</span>&#160;
		The interspace relationship between particles is particularly important if the inner structure comprises particles interacting by energy transfer effects. These energy transfer effects can be a F&#246;rster-effect and/or a Dexter-effect.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0020"></a>[0020]</span>&#160;
		The inner structure of the physical object may also comprise a network of non-linear electrical components and at least one component arranged for the reception and emission of electromagnetic radiation. The response of such a network depends on small irregularities of the conducting interconnection and non-linear electrical components.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0021"></a>[0021]</span>&#160;
		In particular, if the component arranged for the reception and emission of electromagnetic radiation is an antenna for radio wave or micro wave radiation and if the response signal comprises a higher harmonics of the challenge signal the response signal may be affected by small and irreproducible irregularities of the inner structure of the physical object.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0022"></a>[0022]</span>&#160;
		The component arranged for the reception and emission of electromagnetic radiation may also be a photodiode that receives an optical challenge signal.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0023"></a>[0023]</span>&#160;
		The inner structure of the physical device used for the method may finally also comprise a network of non-linear electrical components and electrical contacts for interaction with the measuring device.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0024"></a>[0024]</span>&#160;
		The method may also be used by an authority for assigning a functionality to an remote item by generating a digital signature of an individual description of the object at the remote location based on characteristic of at least one response signal and of an identification of the item using a secret signing key of the authority and by transmitting the digital signature to the remote location of the object. This method has the advantage that the authority can be remote from the actual location of the physical object and the item. These features can be used by a manufacturer for labeling products at a remote location where the products are manufactured. These is particularly useful if so called our production should be inhibited.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0025"></a>[0025]</span>&#160;
		The digital signature of the authority can also be combined with a tag issued by a central authority and comprising a digital authorizing signature of an identification of the authority and public key of the authority using a secret signing key of the central authority. Thus, the public key of the authority needs not to be retrieved from a central data base once the assignment of the physical object to the item is validated. This allows efficient label verification is a scenario with many different label manufacturers.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0026"></a>[0026]</span>&#160;

		An apparatus <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> is called a measuring apparatus for physical objects if it meets the following requirements:
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> is capable of executing a finite number of measurements <span style="font-style:italic">M</span><sup>1</sup>,...,<span style="font-style:italic">M<sup>n</sup></span> on a given physical object.</li><li style="position:relative">2.

<br clear="none"><br>
of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> with respect to <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> such that it is practically infeasible for any cryptographic adversary, and even for the manufacturer of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span>, to produce another object <span style="font-style:italic">O'</span> such that <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>

		We remained relatively vague about the terms "practically infeasible" and "relatively small number of properties" in the definition. There are several reasons for this. First of all, what exactly determines a "practical infeasibility" depends very much on the resources that a cryptographic adversary will apply, which, in turn, strongly depend on the protected value and the application scenario. Recall that a fraudster only benefits from his actions whenever his gains exceed his investments. If he is forced to spend more money on cloning a unique object than he gains afterwards, he will be unlikely to proceed. This means that cheap, but moderately hard to fake unique objects have their justification for certain applications.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0036"></a>[0036]</span>&#160;
		The expression "relatively small number" of properties is subject to the same restrictions, meaning that it is also application dependent. However, we would like to stipulate as a rule of thumb that the unique properties <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
if expressed in binary, should not be longer than 10 <span style="font-style:italic">kB</span>, and will be even shorter in most cases.<br clear="none"><br>

		We will now turn to one of the main applications of unique objects. The so-called "labeling problem" consists of designing unforgeable markers for branded products, passports, banknotes, credit cards and the like. These structures shall be attached to the products, banknotes etc. as a proof of their validity, and shall be unforgeable in the sense that no illegitimate production of a valid label is practically feasible. One further important requirement is that it should be possible to test the validity of a given label through an automatized process.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0038"></a>[0038]</span>&#160;
		In the following, we use terms like Alice, Bob and Eve. These terms represent functional units that are generally used in cryptography. These terms designate functional units that can be implemented by hardware, by software or by a combination of hard- and software in a single physical unit or can be distributed over various physical units.<br clear="none"><br>

</p>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0039"></a>[0039]</span>&#160;
		Unique objects are very well applicable to the labeling problem. One suggestive first approach works as illustrated in Figure 1:
<ul><li style="position:relative">Attach a unique object 1 as a marker to the to-be-labeled item 2, for instance product, passport, bank card, etc. The unique object 1 then represents the label of the item.</li><li style="position:relative">Set up a central database 3, which records the unique properties of all valid labels and which is provided with an online connection 4 with a testing device 5.</li><li style="position:relative">Whenever a given label needs to be tested, the testing device 5 measures the properties of the unique object 1 by applying a challenge signal 6 to the unique object 1 and by receiving a response signal 7 depending on a inner structure 8 of the unique object 1.
<ul><li style="position:relative">Then, the testing device 5 contacts the database via an online connection, and asks whether a label with the measured properties is registered as valid in the database 3.</li><li style="position:relative">If it is registered, then the testing device 5 regards the label as valid, otherwise not.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0040"></a>[0040]</span>&#160;
		This process will be most practical in situations where an online connection to some central institution is required anyway whenever a label is tested. Such examples include bank cards of any kind, possibly also access cards and, to some extent, passports.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0041"></a>[0041]</span>&#160;
		In other cases, such as banknotes, practicality and privacy issues make the use of online databases more intricate (despite zero-knowledge and secure multiparty computation techniques might be applicable here). Together with the facts that online connections between the database and the testing devices need to be authenticated cryptographically, and that the maintenance of the database requires effort, this makes offline solutions attractive.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">
      
<span style="font-weight:bold">2.3 Offline Labeling with Unique Objects and Digital Signatures</span>
    
</p>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0042"></a>[0042]</span>&#160;
		By the term "offline labeling" we refer to labeling systems whose label verification procedure works without an online connection between the testing apparatuses and a database. The main problem in realizing such a solution is that every unique object is a true unicum, meaning that even all valid labels differ from each other. How shall an offline testing device make a distinction between a valid label and an invalid one under these circumstances? The key idea is to use digital signatures in connection with unique objects as illustrated in Figure 2:
<ul><li style="position:relative">In order to generate a valid label 22 a functional unit 21 designated Alice generates the unique object with unique properties <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
</li><li style="position:relative">Then, Alice creates a digital Signature S with <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
where <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> is some additional information related to the to-be-labeled item, for example the branded product, the passport, etc., and <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>A</sub></span> is the secret cryptographic key of Alice.</li><li style="position:relative">The label 22, then, consists of the unique physical object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span>, the numerical strings <span style="font-style:italic">UP , AI ,</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">S</span>. These need to be attached to or stored on the to-be-labeled item 2. While the object 1 can in most cases be attached or glued upon the item 2, said numerical strings can be stored via a two-dimensional barcode, an <span class="highlightable highlight">RFID</span> chips or comparable techniques on the item 1.</li></ul>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0043"></a>[0043]</span>&#160;
		In order to test the label 22 of the described form, a testing device 23 requires the public cryptographic key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>A</sub></span> associated to Alice. Under that provision, the testing device 23 can test a given label 22 consisting of a physical object <span style="font-style:italic">O'</span> and numerical information <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">S</span>, as follows:
<ul><li style="position:relative">The testing device 23 reads the strings <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">S</span> from the label 21 or the item 2, respectively, where they had been stored by a barcode, an <span class="highlightable highlight">RFID</span>-like techniques, or other means.</li><li style="position:relative">The testing device 23 checks the digital signature S for validity by use of the key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>A</sub>.</span>
</li><li style="position:relative">The testing device 23 physically measures the properties <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
of the unique object <span style="font-style:italic">O'</span> that is part of the label 22. Then, the testing device 23 checks if these properties match the unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> that it read in step 1. In other words, it checks if <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
</li><li style="position:relative">The testing device 23 considers the label as valid if and only if both checks have been successful.</li></ul>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0044"></a>[0044]</span>&#160;
		Please note that the testing procedure does not require online connections or any central databases. Furthermore, it works without any secret keys stored in the testing devices. This is a huge asset whenever these devices are widespread, or are issued to many persons, such as in the typical credit card setting, or in conceivable scenarios where citizens can check the validity of banknotes in an automatized fashion by small handheld devices, for example via their mobile phones.<br clear="none"><br>

		What do we mean by the term "remote generation of a label"?<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0046"></a>[0046]</span>&#160;
		In section 2.3, we assumed that the person holding the unique object also was in possession of the secret key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>A</sub>,</span> and could generate the label by himself, without external assistance. This is not necessarily so: In certain settings it may be useful that the key and the object are held by two different entities, which have to cooperate in order to generate a label.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0047"></a>[0047]</span>&#160;
		Figure 3 illustrates the situation. Suppose that a functional unit 31 designated Alice holds the unique object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> with unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> , a functional unit 32 designated Bob holds a secret key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>B</sub></span>, and that both are located separately from each other and can communicate via a binary channel 33. Now we can ask whether there is a communication protocol with the following properties:<ol><li style="position:relative">1. If both parties follow the protocol, then Alice is able to generate a valid label 34 consisting of the object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and the numerical information <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">S.</span>
</li><li style="position:relative">2. Even if Alice deviates maliciously from the protocol, she will be unable to generate more than one label 34 during or after the protocol.</li></ol>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0048"></a>[0048]</span>&#160;
		We call a protocol which meets these properties a remote generation of the label 34. The following procedure allows such a remote generation of the labels 34:
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Alice sends the unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> of her object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and the additional information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> to Bob.
<ul compact="compact"><li style="position:relative">Alternatively, Bob may already hold the information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> at the beginning of the protocol, or may form the information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> signed in step 3 by himself, as a function of the data that he receives from Alice and that he holds himself.</li></ul>
</li><li style="position:relative">2. Bob convinces himself of the fact that the properties that he received are non-trivial, and that they may correspond to a real unique object. He can do so by comparing the data that he received with some pre-defined format or threshold. He aborts the protocol if he finds the data unsuitable.</li><li style="position:relative">3. Bob returns the signature <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
to Alice.</li><li style="position:relative">4. Alice forms the valid label 34 consisting of the unique physical object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and the numerical information <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">S</span>.</li></ol>

		Please note that step 2, where Bob performs some check on the data that he is going to sign, can be necessary because Alice could otherwise send some bogus information that refers to the features of an easily reproducible or trivial object. Let us give an example to illustrate the point. Suppose that the unique object 1 is a random distribution of optically active nanoparticles in a suitable matrix. The unique properties of such an object 1 could consist of the precise location and size of some of the nanoparticles. Now it is conceivable to find some trivial arrangements (for example, no nanoparticles contained at all; or all particles concentrated tightly in one small area) which a faker can reproduce. Bob must convince himself that the data he signs does not refer to such a trivial and reproducible arrangement. In the described example, this step might consist of verifying that the locations and sizes of the particles are uniformly or Gaussian distributed. Generally, the procedure Bob is going to apply depends on the precise nature of the employed unique objects.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0050"></a>[0050]</span>&#160;

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0051"></a>[0051]</span>&#160;
		Please note further that we assumed that the communication channel between Alice and Bob is authenticated. If it is not, then both can take standard measured (see [33, 21]) to achieve authenticity. Furthermore, the communication between Alice and Bob can be encrypted if required (see, again, [33, 21]).<br clear="none"><br>

		If labels from more than one generating institution shall be tested, such as in a typical consumer product scenario with different manufacturers, then we have at least three basic possibilities to achieve this goal:
<p class="dec novs">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 1:</span> The testing devices need to store the public keys of all possible manufacturers. Besides the high storage requirements, this has another disadvantage: It is difficult for new manufacturers to enter the system once a large number of testing devices has been set up and distributed. Since they are offline, the new keys have to be entered manually, with suitable security procedures by authorised personnel.</p>
<p class="dec novs">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 2:</span> A central institution is established with a central, secret signing key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>CI</sub>.</span> This institution can sign so-called (numerical) "tags" for each legitimate label generator. A (numerical) tag <span style="font-style:italic">T<sub>G</sub></span> of some label generator <span style="font-style:italic">G</span> could have the form <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
where <span style="font-style:italic">ID<sub>G</sub></span> is a string that suitably describes the identity of the label generator, and <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span> is the public key that corresponds to the secret key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>G</sub></span> of the label generator <span style="font-style:italic">G</span> . The tags may further include expiration dates and other data, signed or unsigned.<br clear="none"><br>
Each label generator <span style="font-style:italic">G</span> includes his numerical tag <span style="font-style:italic">T<sub>G</sub></span> into the numerical information of all labels that he generates. If a testing device is presented with a numerical tag <span style="font-style:italic">T<sub>G</sub></span> and a standard label consisting of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">UP,AI, Sig<sub>SKG</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>), it first of all checks the validity of the tag by verifying the signature <span style="font-style:italic">Sig<sub>SKCI</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">ID<sub>G</sub></span>,<span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span>) included in the tag. If this signature is valid, the testing device knows that it should use the key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span> in order to check the validity of the label, <span style="font-style:italic">viz</span>. of the second signature <span style="font-style:italic">S=Sig<sub>SKG</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>).<br clear="none"><br>
Please note that the use of tags only requires the testing devices to store the single key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>CI</sub></span> in order to verify labels from all manufacturers.</p>
<p class="dec novs">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 3:</span> An identity-based signature scheme is used [17]. Structurally, this turns out to be almost equivalent to the tag solution presented in the last item.<br clear="none"><br>
These solutions are secure, but in a consumer market scenario with many label generators, they have one disadvantage. If one of the label generators loses its key (for example through a hacker break-in or simple theft), then this key must be revoked from all testing devices. Otherwise, the hackers can use this key in order to commit fraud, and insert faked specimen into the circulation of goods. Such revocation can both be difficult to realize and expensive, especially if the testing devices are widespread and offline. One possible approach to circumvent this problem is based on the remote generation of labels, and can be described as follows.</p>
<p class="dec novs">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 4:</span> Set up one central institution <span style="font-style:italic">CI</span> which possesses a secret signing key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>CI</sub>'</span> and which generates the labels for all manufacturers remotely, as described in section 3.4. Here, each manufacturer must hold sufficiently many unique objects at his site, and the manufacturers must maintain authenticated online connections with the central institution.</p>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0054"></a>[0054]</span>&#160;

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0058"></a>[0058]</span>&#160;
		The remote generation of labels of section 2.4 can be particularly helpful in banknote labeling. Consider the typical scenario in which the notes 41 are printed at a number of different decentral sites. In such a setting, the concern of the headquarters would be to prevent unauthorized fabrication at the sites, and to rule out that fraudsters could steal the secret keys from the sites. Both problems can be encountered by remotely generating the necessary labels between the headquarters and sites as described in section 2.4.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0059"></a>[0059]</span>&#160;
		Here, the additional information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> may include personal data such as name, address, date of birth, and also biometrics such as fingerprint or iris data. These biometrics can be checked with the card or passport holder in addition to the genuineness of the label, which will enhance the security of the scheme.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0060"></a>[0060]</span>&#160;
		Figure 5 shows an identity card 51. The identity card 51 is provided with the unique object 1 and may also be provided with a picture 52 of the card holder, biometric data 53 plus additional information 54 such as the name of the card holder printed in alphanumerical signs, a digital information string <span style="font-style:italic">I</span> or a digital signature <span style="font-style:italic">Sig</span><sub>sK(I</sub>, <sub>AI)</sub>. The string <span style="font-style:italic">I</span> may contain any data regarding the card owner, including a full binary description of the picture or the biometric data. Alternatively, hash values of these numerical values may be used. <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> may be any additional side information that is only included in the signature, but not stored publicly on the card.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0061"></a>[0061]</span>&#160;
		Again, one can imagine to employ a remote generation of the labels, as described in section 2.4. This allows the decentral generation of passports or ID cards at local authorities, which could considerably speed up the issuing of passports. Also access cards can be issued decentrally and more conveniently through that scheme.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0062"></a>[0062]</span>&#160;
		Passports also fit relatively well with central databases and online checking, since the police or customs authorities may well have implemented authenticated connections to a central headquarter. Other potential verifiers of passports (hotels, banks, etc.) probably would need to check via a digital signature that would be included in the label, according to section 2.3.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0063"></a>[0063]</span>&#160;
		Access cards also often allow the use of central databases, since the entry in security zones may need to be registered centrally anyway. If privacy is required, then digital signatures and offline validation or central database with zero-knowledge and secure multiparty computation techniques can be employed.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Permission Tokens</span>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0064"></a>[0064]</span>&#160;
		Let us now discuss one particular concept which we call a permission token. Consider a situation where a customer wants to acquire concert tickets over the internet. One would like to avoid sending out the tickets via postal delivery after the purchase, since it is tedious and creates extra costs. Instead, it would be convenient if the customer could print out tickets by himself. As long as only digital information is sent over an insecure connection from the concert agency to the customer to that aim, however, an eavesdropper can just as well print out the tickets. Furthermore, the customer might print out the tickets multiple times.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0065"></a>[0065]</span>&#160;
		Our techniques allow a very direct solution to that problem. Suppose that the customer holds a unique object. Then, he can send its unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> to the concert agency, which returns a signature of the unique properties and some additional information which may contain the concert date, seat number, etc. The customer can print out that information in a machine readable form, or store it in some other way (e.g. on an <span class="highlightable highlight">RFID</span> chip, via printed barcodes, etc.). The unique object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span>, the unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> , the information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> , and the signature <span style="font-style:italic">Sig<sub>SKCA</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>) then form a "permission token" that the customer can bring with him in order to gain access to the concert. The process of generating this permission token basically follows the remote generation of labels of section 2.4.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0066"></a>[0066]</span>&#160;
		Please note that this scheme can be generalized in order to distribute permission tokens of any kind over public channels. Another example would be permission tokens that allow you to collect postal packages from locked, automatized parcel deposit boxes.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0067"></a>[0067]</span>&#160;
		The main advantage of the scheme is its cost effectiveness. If an equivalent scheme was to be realized via classical mathematical means, then a secret key - public key pair needed to be stored on a smart card. This makes the cost per card or per permission token significantly higher than in our case. Another advantage is that storing a secret key on a smart card rises extra security issues, while our scheme works without any secret keys on the permission tokens.<br clear="none"><br>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0068"></a>[0068]</span>&#160;
		In this case, the additional information typically would include customer data, expiration dates, and similar data, and could also contain biometrics such as fingerprints, iris scans or the like. Again, the remote generation of labels allows the issuing of the cards at decentral branches. Bank cards also allow the favorable use of central databases, since the account data needs to be checked before any payment anyway. The use of digital signatures can maintain anonymity, for example in case of money cards. On the issuing of the cards, the original signature can be created as a blind signature [20].<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0069"></a>[0069]</span>&#160;
		If PINs are used in connection with such bankcards, then an ideal system arises where the ability to make payments requires something that you have (the card), something that you know (the PIN), and something that you are (the biometrics). For further explanations on this threefold distinction see, for example, [21]).<br clear="none"><br>

		The secure labeling of branded products differs from the above scenarios, since we need to deal with a very large number of manufacturers that fabricate products and which, thus, need to generate valid labels. At the same time, the setting requires that the labels from all manufacturers can be verified by one type of testing device, for example in a supermarket, in pharmacies, or along supply chains. This suggests to use either only databases, or one of the techniques described in section 2.5 (many stored keys, tags, ID-based signatures, remote generation of labels). In particular, the remote generation of labels seems to be a very elegant solution to the problem.<br clear="none"><br>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0071"></a>[0071]</span>&#160;
		We will now discuss how unique objects can be applied to create representations of digital content that resist illegitimate duplication. Please note in this context that standard binary techniques such as digital watermarks per se do not prevent copying, but only ex post allow to identify the entity that created a content. This property of a digital watermark can in principle be used to prevent illegitimate duplication, but only under the assumption that any copying attempts take place in environments which have some copy control mechanisms implemented. Examples include trusted software or hardware platforms that forbid any duplication of watermarked content. If a fraudster is able to create his own environment, for example a manipulated operating system or a purpose built read and write hardware device, then digital watermarks are useless: The fraudster can copy the content bit by bit, including the watermark, with all copies being indistinguishable from the original, and then go on to sell this content, for example CDs or DVDs. While such attacks may be without the reach of the average user, they pose no problem for educated pirates.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0072"></a>[0072]</span>&#160;
		This motivates the search for copy protection systems that also resists attacks by educated adversaries. The difficulty here is that any bitstring representing some digital content can in principle be duplicated at will. This suggests to link a physically unique and non-reproducible physical object to the trivially reproducible bitstring.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">
      
<span style="font-weight:bold">3.2 Unique Objects and Copy-Protected Content</span>
    
</p>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0073"></a>[0073]</span>&#160;
		A copy-protection system that incorporates unique objects can be built right on the techniques that we have presented in section 2.3. It would work in the following fashion:
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. First of all, we stipulate that any legitimate representation of some digital content <span style="font-style:italic">I</span> must consist of a unique physical object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span>, the numerical expression <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> of the unique properties of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span>, some additional information <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> and a digital signature <span style="font-style:italic">Sig<sub>SKP</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">I</span>) of the issuer of the digital content. Thereby <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>P</sub></span> is the secret key of the provider <span style="font-style:italic">P</span> of the digital content.</li><li style="position:relative">2. In order to check whether a given representation of digital content is a legitimate representation, any playing device needs to execute the following steps:
<ul><li style="position:relative">The playing device checks the validity of the digital signature by use of the public key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>P</sub></span> that is associated with the content provider <span style="font-style:italic">P.</span>
</li><li style="position:relative">The playing device checks if the object <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> indeed possesses the unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP.</span>
</li></ul>
</li><li style="position:relative">3. The playing device plays the content if and only if both checks have been positive.</li></ol>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0074"></a>[0074]</span>&#160;
		Please note that the role of the unique object can at times also be played by the storage medium that stores the digital content, such as the CD or DVD itself. These media may either have unique properties right from the start, or can intentionally be manufactured to have unique features. One possibility is, for example, to distribute light scattering particles (for example gold or silver nanoparticles) randomly on the surface of a CD or DVD.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<p style="font-weight:bold">
      
<span style="font-weight:bold">3.3 Remote Generation of Copy-Protected Content</span>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0075"></a>[0075]</span>&#160;
		Also the generation of copy-protected content can be executed in a remote fashion between one party that holds the unique object and another party that holds the secret signing key. The procedure is basically the same as in the remote generation of labels described in section 3.4. Presuming that Alice holds a unique object or unique storage medium <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> with unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> , and that Bob holds a secret key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>B</sub>,</span> they can proceed as follows.
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Alice sends the unique properties <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span> of the unique storage medium <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> she holds, to Bob.</li><li style="position:relative">2. Bob convinces himself of the fact that the properties that he received are non-trivial, and that any object which possesses these properties are, in fact, unreproducible.</li><li style="position:relative">3. Bob returns the signature <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
Thereby <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span> denotes some additional information that Bob may include, and <span style="font-style:italic">C</span> denotes the digital content that shall be issued in a copy-protected form.</li><li style="position:relative">4. Alice forms a valid representation of the content <span style="font-style:italic">C</span> consisting of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">C</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">S</span>.</li></ol>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0076"></a>[0076]</span>&#160;
		Please note that the protocol leaves open whether Alice receives <span style="font-style:italic">C</span> directly from Bob, or whether she obtained it from some other source. Both possibilities are conceivable. As in section 2.4, step 2 is necessary, since Alice could otherwise send some bogus information that refers to the features of an easily reproducible or trivial object.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0077"></a>[0077]</span>&#160;
		Basically the same considerations as in section 2.5 also apply in the context of copy protected content. Suppose that more than one content providers want to be able to generate legitimate representations of content in the sense of section 4.2. Then, as in section 3.5, we have the following basic possibilities.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0078"></a>[0078]</span>&#160;
		<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 1:</span> The playing devices need to store the public keys of all possible content providers. Besides the storage requirements, this has another disadvantage: It is difficult for new content providers to enter the system once a large number of offline playing devices has been set up and distributed.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0079"></a>[0079]</span>&#160;
		<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 2:</span> A central institution is established with a central, secret signing key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>CI</sub>.</span> This institution can sign so-called "tags" for each legitimate content provider. A tag <span style="font-style:italic">T</span> of some label generator G could have the form<br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
<br clear="none"><br>
where <span style="font-style:italic">ID<sub>G</sub></span> is a string that suitably describes the identity of the label generator, and <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span> is the public key of the label generator.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0080"></a>[0080]</span>&#160;
		These tags are included in the labels. If a playing device is presented with a tag <span style="font-style:italic">T</span> and a standard label consisting of <span style="font-style:italic">O</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">Sig<sub>SKG</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>), it first of all checks the validity of the signature <span style="font-style:italic">Sig<sub>SKCI</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">ID<sub>G</sub></span>,<span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span>) that is part of the tag. If this signature is valid, the playing device knows that it should use the key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>G</sub></span> in order to check the validity of the label, <span style="font-style:italic">viz</span>. of the signature <span style="font-style:italic">S=Sig<sub>SKG</sub></span> (<span style="font-style:italic">UP</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">AI</span>)<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>
<br clear="none"><br>
The described procedure only requires the playing device to store the single key <span style="font-style:italic">PK<sub>CI</sub></span> in order to be able to verify the validity of labels from all manufacturers.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0081"></a>[0081]</span>&#160;
		<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 3:</span> An identity-based signature scheme is used [17]. Structurally, this turns out to be almost equivalent to the tag solution presented in the last item.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0082"></a>[0082]</span>&#160;
		These solutions are secure, but in a practical scenario with many content providers, they have one potential disadvantage. If one of the content providers loses its key (for example through a hacker break-in or simple theft), then this key must be revoked from all playing devices. Otherwise, the hackers can insert illegitimate copies into the circulation of contents. Such revocation can be difficult to realize, however, if the playing devices are widespread and offline. One possible approach that can circumvent this problem can be based on the remote generation of copy protected content, and can be described as follows.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0083"></a>[0083]</span>&#160;
		<span style="font-weight:bold">Possibility 4:</span> Set up a central institution <span style="font-style:italic">CI</span> which possesses a secret signing key <span style="font-style:italic">SK<sub>CI</sub>.</span> and which generates legitimate representations of content with all content providers remotely as described in section 3.3. This presumes that each content provider holds sufficiently many unique objects or unique storage media at his site, and that the content providers maintain authenticated online connections with the central institution.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0084"></a>[0084]</span>&#160;
		The advantage of possibility 4 is that it can be adjusted easily to occurring changes regarding the content providers. If new providers arise, or old providers want to leave the system or go bankrupt, the system can be adjusted very easily, since key revocation from the playing devices is unnecessary.<br clear="none"><br>

		We can probably cut ourselves short on the application side, since it should be relatively clear from what we have said so far. The main applications of the presented techniques are the copy protection of any digital content such as video and audio material, computer programs, or any other sort of digital data.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0086"></a>[0086]</span>&#160;
		Please note, however, that the presented technique is only applicable when the reading or playing devices can execute an analogue measurement on the unique object that is part of the representation of the copy protected content. This certainly holds for CDs and DVDs, since the player reads out the storage medium in an analogue optical fashion. It may or may not hold for storage media like USB sticks and hard disks, since they may read out the digital content by themselves, and may pass on the content in a binary format to the reading (meta-)device, for example the computer system. This strongly depends on the specific situation and application.<br clear="none"><br>

		One possible embodiment of unique objects consists in a random distribution of optically active particles (dyemolecules, quantum dots, colourcenters) in a suitable matrix (thin polymer film, small optically active crystal, etc.). Such a system would contain information in the form of spatial position and orientation of particles, spectral properties of particles, time dependent optical behavior (e.g. decay times). In addition all of the above properties of a given particle can be influenced significantly by interaction with one or more of the other particles present in the system. Furthermore, the optical properties of the object can be influenced reversibly or irreversibly by external parameters such as electrical field, magnetic field, temperature or light intensity.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0089"></a>[0089]</span>&#160;
		For the present application it is of particular importance that the location, correlation and physical properties of the particles can be prepared in a sufficiently random fashion, so that the particle system will be difficult to clone or reproduce. Furthermore, the unique properties of the object can be read out in a rather simple, reliable, inexpensive and time efficient manner.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0090"></a>[0090]</span>&#160;
		The physical principle behind the object as described above lies in the influence of a matrix on the specific properties of an optically active particle in this matrix. The matrix provides protection of the particle against undesired external influences and fixes the relative spatial positions and orientations of the particles. The basic physical quantity to be detected is the spatially resolved (point of origin and spatial angles of the response) and temporally resolved (e.g. decay times, characteristic time variations of the signal) optical response (luminescence, fluorescence, phosphorescence) to a continuous wave optical excitation or short laser pulses with different frequencies, intensities, polarizations, duration, coordinates of incidence, laser spot diameter and shape, and direction of the laser beam. This optical response contains the individual spectral characteristics of each particle, the intensity or quantum efficiency, saturation effects, decay times, statistical on/off "blinking", polarization, polarization memory, temperature and field dependence. All of these properties in principle will be influenced by spatial correlations between particles with different properties (quenching, F&#246;rster transfer, Dexter transfer, change of polarization properties etc.) which depend strongly on the relative distance between two or more particles as well as on their individual optical properties, their position and orientation in the matrix, and the properties of the matrix.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0091"></a>[0091]</span>&#160;

		One embodiment which can be realized with inexpensive starting material and which would hence be suitable for mass production consists of silicon nanoparticles of different size and shape within a transparent polymer matrix. The precursor polymers and particles can be prepared in the form of a liquid suspension which is then transformed into a thin film on substrate by conventional printing and/or spin coating techniques. Physical variables are the optical properties of the polymer matrix (e.g. homogeneous polymers, mixed polymers, polymer blends, etc.) as well as the size and shape distribution, surface termination and concentration of the particles. In addition, the silicon particles which usually are non-luminescent because of surface defects and/or the indirect nature of the band structure, can be transformed into well-known form of highly luminescent porous silicon by suitable methods such as stain etching. These two forms of silicon particles thus differ in a large number of the physical properties mentioned in the previous section, as described in the extensive literature on that subject. Finally, the silicon particles can be combined with other optically active nano-particles such as other semiconductor quantum dots, organic dye molecules (with singlet or triplet excited states) or metallic nano-particles with particular plasmonic properties.<br clear="none"><br>

		By using semiconductor nanoparticle tetrapods, at whose ends for example a dye has been attached or a semiconductor material with a different band gap has been grown, one may obtain a complex spatial object. The fluorescent behavior of the four dyes then depends on their relative position to each other. If the dyes show different absorption and emission behavior, a complex F&#246;rster Transfer arises between the single fluorescence centers. Through imperfections and variations in the production process, for example different mutual distances of the fluorescence centers, the complexity of the fluorescent behavior and thereby the security against counterfeiting is further increased. These imperfections or variations may also be induced by attaching the dyes or nanoparticles to the end of the tetrapods by linkers of different length or structure. Upon encapsulation in a suitable polymer matrix, the linkers will take different and essentially random spatial positions and angles, which will subsequently be fixed in the matrix and infeasible to reproduce.

Through employment of geometrically complex geometric cluster of metal nanorods and single metal nanorods, the fluorescence amplification can be made polarization dependent. Due to the very quick reactivity of the matrix on changes of polarizations, a possible detection of the excitation signal and an artificial generation of the desired pattern by an LCD array or similar means should only be possible at much slower timescales.

		Figure 11 shows a composite object with a special silica substrate 111 on which silver islands 112 are formed. The silver islands 112 are covered by a silica layer 113 on which quantum dots made from CdSe/ZnS are formed. The silica layer 113 and the quantum dots 114 are covered by a protective cover 115 that is made of acrylic glass.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0107"></a>[0107]</span>&#160;
		The silver islands on the silica substrate form at low evaporation rates and a layer thickness around 10 nm. In this case, more or less spherical silver islands form on the substrate. They typically have a diameter between 10 to 15 nm and a thickness between 10 and 18 nm. The spaces between the silver islands 112 can vary between a few nm to 100 nm and are free from silver. For making the size distribution of the silver islands 112 more homogeneous, a rapid thermal annealing process is conducted at temperatures around 250 &#176;C resulting in restructuring of the silver island 112. Smaller silver islands 112 dissolve and their material is accumulating on the larger silver islands 112 which also become higher. Furthermore, the spaces between the silver islands 112 are increasing. After silver islands 112 have reached their appropriate sizes, the silica layer 113 is deposited on the probe by a sputtering process resulting in a silica layer 113 with a thickness greater than 100 nm. After the sputtering process has been finished, the quantum dots 114 are distributed over the silica layer 113 by using a toluol solution, in which the quantum dots are solved. After the quantum dots are distributed over the silica layer 113 the whole structure is sealed by the protective cover 115 to prevent the quantum dots from oxidation.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0108"></a>[0108]</span>&#160;
		The unique object 1 depicted in figure 11 uses the so called effective Purcell-effect. A free quantum dot 114 absorbs light below a particular wave length that corresponds to the energy gap of its first band transition. By the absorption of light at a particular energy, electron-hole-pairs, so called exitones, are formed. The exitones can recombine thereby emit light that has a greater wave length than the light absorbed previously. The recombination rate of the exitones is considerably shortened if the quantum dots 114 are exposed to a strong electric field, thus enhancing the photo luminescence of the quantum dots 114.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0109"></a>[0109]</span>&#160;
		The strong electric field is generated by particle plasmons on the silver islands 112. The particle plasmons are excited by incident light and form electrical dipole fields that are significantly stronger than the field of the exciting photons. The strength of the field is strongest in the vicinity of the silver islands 112 and decreases with increasing distance from the silver islands 112.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0110"></a>[0110]</span>&#160;
		The plasmons may be excited directly by light whose frequency fits to the resonance frequency of the plasmons. The other possibility is to excite the quantum dots 114 which absorb light at shorter wavelengths and emit the light at longer wavelengths. The silver island 112 are now grown such and covered such with SiO<sub>2</sub> that the resulting plasmon resonance also covers the emission wavelength of the quantum dots 114. Thus, a part of the light emitted by the quantum dots 114 is used for exciting the plasmons and generates the electrical field. The relative position of the spectra is shown in Figure 12, where an absorption characteristic 121 and an emission characteristic 122 of the quantum dots 114 is shown. Figure 12 further shows the plasmon resonance 123 that is situated in the region of the emission characteristic 122 of the quantum dots. 114.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0111"></a>[0111]</span>&#160;
		It should be noted that there are also parallel processes. For instance, the plasmons may also decay by emitting light into free space where the light emitted by the plasmons is detected besides the light emitted by the quantum dots 114, or the plasmon may loose their energy in collision processes with the lattice and are converted into phonons, in particular, heating. The exitones can also decay without the emission of photons. These other possibilities become more dominant if the distance between the quantum dots 114 and the silver islands 112 becomes too small. Then, the photo luminescence is rather damped than enhanced.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0112"></a>[0112]</span>&#160;
		If the wavelength of the instant light is too long, the incident light will result in the excitation of plasmon in the silver islands 112 besides the excitation of excitons in the quantum dots 114.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0113"></a>[0113]</span>&#160;
		If the population rate of the plasmon modes due to the coupling between the exitons of the quantum dots 114 and the plasmons of the silver islands 112 is more efficient than the decay rate of the plasmons, then the population of the plasmon modes increases rapidly and a SPASER (= Surface Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) results. However, this is quite unlikely in the present structure.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0114"></a>[0114]</span>&#160;
		Another effect is caused by so called plasmonic lenses that refer to the amplification of electric fields in the space between silver islands 112. These plasmonic lenses are sometimes also called hot spots. In addition, the resonance frequency of the plasmons changes if the distance between the silver islands 112 decreases. On the one hand, the coupling between the plasmons of adjacent silver islands 112 may results in low energy levels of a joined plasmon and therefore causes a red shift of the resonance frequency. Also higher energy levels of a joined plasmon can result. If these higher energy levels are populated the electric fields between the silver islands 112 are not enhanced since the electric fields cancel each other instead of adding to a electric field with a higher field strength. The enhancement of the electrical field between the silver particles is, however, more likely because the enhancement of the electrical field between the silver islands 112 relates to the low energy level that are more likely to be populated.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0115"></a>[0115]</span>&#160;
		Another effect is the polarization dependency of the interaction between the silver islands 112. If the light is linearly polarized parallel to axis connecting the silver island 112 the electrical field between the silver islands 112 is enhanced. The system of the silver islands 112, however, reacts only weakly with respect to light that is linearly polarized and assumes a right angle with respect to the axis connecting the silver islands 112. These polarization dependency is also important for none-spherical particles.<br clear="none"><br>

		For validating the unique object from Figure 11 the unique object 1 from Figure 11 is irradiated by laser light whose wavelength is well below the resonance frequency of the plasmons and that pumps the quantum dots 114 efficiently. The laser light originates from a laser which is operated in the continuous wave mode so that the enhancement of the photoluminescence can be optimally used. In such a mode, also the interaction between the silver islands 112 becomes important.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0117"></a>[0117]</span>&#160;

		Surface plasmon excitations on each metallic nanoparticle couple to adjacent particles, provided that their physical separation (distance) is far below the wavelength of the plasmon mode. Light propagation then proceeds via a complex percolation path through the material and the spatial distribution of the intensities would be very sensitive to the point of incidence of or other characteristics of the laser beam (e.g. polarization, intensity, etc.) and on the physical properties of the system (particle size, shape, distribution, material, etc.).

		Let us now argue in favor of the security of the suggested implementations of unique objects with respect to the following essential aspects.
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Uniqueness in the production process: The nature of the manufacturing process guaranties that it is highly unlikely that two objects are produced that exhibit the same properties with respect to a given measurement protocol. The realization schemes described above rely on nondeterministic preparation methods such as mixing, coagulation, nucleation and growth, random scattering events of ions and particles, diffusion, formation of particle clusters, local crystallization or amorphization. Depending on the sensitivity of the envisaged detection system, the preparation conditions can be tailored in such a way that the probability of undistinguishable objects can be made very small.</li><li style="position:relative">2. Non-Copyability: It is hard for a counterfeiter to copy the unique object. The use of correlated particle systems, whose optical properties depend strongly on the relative distance and the spectral properties of correlated particles (e.g. the F&#246;rster Transfer, whose efficiency decreases as a high power of the spatial distance and only works for particles with almost identical transition energies). This provides sensitivity to distance variations on the Angstrom scale, even if the spatial resolution of the detection system (e.g. of a CCD-camera) is much lower (since distance and spatial correlation information is transformed into spectral information, temporal information or intensity information). Hence, in order to copy such a system, the faker would have to assemble a macroscopic system containing a large number of optically active particles with atomic precision. These difficulties persist even if only a few properties of the macroscopic system are measured. A further complication consists in the fact that external parameters might be used in the measurement process. Hence not only the spatial position but also other parameters such as orientation and further properties of the particles and the matrix have to be imitated by the fraudster.</li><li style="position:relative">3. Stability: Due to the use of a suitable and stable matrix, various levels of mechanical, chemical, thermal, optical, electrical and other forms of inertness can be achieved.</li><li style="position:relative">4. No Mimic or Imitation Systems: The proposed system relies solely on optical emission and/or transparency in a limited spectral range. It does not require an external power supply other than the purely optical excitation signal external and does not need the capability for electrical data processing or transfer. A mimic system would require a photonic synthesizer, which could generate deliberate photonic patterns in reaction to the possibly varying external excitation conditions. This obviously would require active optical elements (e.g. LED arrays), an internal power supply or an antenna, and electrical data processing capabilities (e.g. driver circuits). These components can be distinguished and detected from a purely optical system by conventional spectroscopic means, and in many cases will be distinguishable form the original structures through their slower response time.</li></ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0137"></a>[0137]</span>&#160;
		One elegant solution to implement unique objects is to make use of the well-known phenomenon of F&#246;rster energy transfer between two nanoparticles [10]. The transferred energy thereby critically depends on the particle distance, with an observable structural sensitivity of 1 <span style="font-style:italic">nm</span> or even below. Furthermore, it can be measured relatively conveniently through recording the relative light intensities of the particles. Thus, F&#246;rster transfer allows us to indirectly observe spatial distances rather conveniently and at very high resolutions.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0138"></a>[0138]</span>&#160;
		Again, however, some practical problems must be dealt with on implementing this idea. Energy transfer effects only occur when the spatial distance between the donor and the acceptor is small enough, typically on the order of a few nanometers. Thus, the chance that in a relatively sparsely concentrated particle distribution two particles come close enough is prohibitively low. On the other hand, rising the concentration too high makes it very difficult to observe single transfers between two particles. Therefore the particles need to be bond together chemically. One advantageous method consists of using DNA strands, since they allow relatively good, but not perfect control of the distances between the molecules. In a first attempt, one might thus proceed as follows in order to generate a unique object:
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Bind quantum dots of two different sizes to a suitable number of DNA strands, in a distance that is close to the F&#246;rster radius <span style="font-style:italic">r<sub>o</sub></span>.</li><li style="position:relative">2. Distribute and subsequently passivate the strands randomly in a suitable polymer matrix. The expectation would be that this fixes the distance of each particle pair randomly and uniquely, with each distance varying around the F&#246;rster radius <span style="font-style:italic">r</span><sub>0</sub>. The concentration of the DNA complexes should be such that in each <span style="font-style:italic">unit cell</span>, that can later be resolved by the employed microscope, on average <span style="font-style:italic">one</span> complex is located.</li></ol>
<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0139"></a>[0139]</span>&#160;
		The unique properties of this object, then, consist mainly of the unique sizes and frequencies of the dots and the unique distance between each quantum dot pair. Given the previous discussion, it seems suggestive to measure them as follows:
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Illuminate the structure with a frequency <span style="font-style:italic">F</span><sub>1</sub> that excites only the acceptor of each quantum dot pair.</li><li style="position:relative">2. Measure the response of the structure in each unit cell, including the irradiated frequencies and light intensities.

Both <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> and <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> depend on the size and geometry of the dot. At the same time, no response from the donor dot is expected. That is, the intensity of the donor frequency should be zero in each unit cell: <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
</li><li style="position:relative">3. Illuminate the structure with a frequency <span style="font-style:italic">F</span><sub>2</sub> that excites the donor of each pair. This time, we expect that both the donor and the acceptor are excited due to an occuring energy transfer. Thus, in each unit cell <span style="font-style:italic">i</span> we should observe signals at the two frequencies <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> 
<br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>
</li></ol>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0140"></a>[0140]</span>&#160;

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0141"></a>[0141]</span>&#160;
		The described measurement procedure should be executed on two basic occassions: First of all to determine the properties of the unique object in a first measurement at its original manufacturer, and also later whenever the structure needs to be tested for its unique properties (for example, when a banknote or an EC card are tested for their validity). Thereby it will probably make sense to only test the relative ratio between <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> and <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> and the fact that <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br> since these figures are more environmentally stable.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0143"></a>[0143]</span>&#160;
		The above procedure provides a good starting point for further considerations, but cannot be called secure, since there are a number of possible aspects in which a fraudster can mount an attack. Let us discuss these security issues now.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0144"></a>[0144]</span>&#160;
		One possible attack arises through the exploitation of the fact that any fluorescent dye has a different absorption and emission curve. This can make it possible to mix two dyes in such a manner that they imitate the reactive behaviour of the DNA-based nanocomplexes described in the previous section: At frequency <span style="font-style:italic">F</span><sub>1</sub>, dye 1 absorbs and emits, while dye 2 does not absorb and emit at all. At frequency <span style="font-style:italic">F</span><sub>2</sub>, both dyes emit and absorb. Mixing them in the right relative concentration will imitate the ratio between the intensities <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>and <br clear="none"><br>[IMAGE]<br clear="none"><br>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0145"></a>[0145]</span>&#160;
		A further security concern arises through the fact that we can measure the relative intensities and thus the energy transfer rate only with limited accuracy. This implies that we can conclude about the distance between the acceptor and donor only with limited precision. In practice, we can effectively only distinguish between a finite number of different intervals of distance. Please note also that the transfer rate is always 1 for distances sufficiently smaller than <span style="font-style:italic">r</span><sub>0</sub>, and 0 for distances significantly larger than <span style="font-style:italic">r</span><sub>0</sub>. Thus, the energy transfer gives us no information about the distance of the particles in these regimes.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0146"></a>[0146]</span>&#160;
		This fact poses problems on the security of the suggested approach. Let us assume for the sake of the argument that we can distinguish reliably between 20 different distance intervals or "bins". That means that whenever a fraudster repeats our manufacturing process and generates a DNA-strand with two attached quantum dots, whose distance varies around <span style="font-style:italic">r</span><sub>0</sub>, then he has a chance of 1/20 that he hits the same interval or bin as the original structure that he tries to fake. Hence, in order to reproduce a given donor--acceptor pair, a fraudster could simply generate a rather small number of DNA-complexes, passivate them, and subsequently select the one where the right distance ocured by chance.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0147"></a>[0147]</span>&#160;
		Subsequently, the fraudster may repeat the process and produce a stock of pairs for each of the possible 20 distances. Given a certain unique object, he can then reproduce this object through use of his stock and suitable micropositioning techniques, which enable him to move the right complex into the right unit cell. Please note that these micropositioning techniques do not need to achieve higher resolutions than the length of one unit cell, which was assumed to be on the order of 1 &#181;<span style="font-style:italic">m</span> at the end of section 2.1. Micropositioning at these lengthscale appears to be feasible.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0148"></a>[0148]</span>&#160;
		Also the different frequencies of the particles do not provide a sufficient guarantee against this attack. Since they can only be measured with limited accuracy, too, a fraudster can build a stock of particles sorted by their size or frequency, respectively. He can then choose the right particles from the stock or "library" to achieve his 1/20 chance that we described in the last paragraph. We call this sort of attack a "library attack".<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0149"></a>[0149]</span>&#160;
		To summarise, we need to require that the structural complexity of the nanocomplexes contained in each unit cell is so high that fabrication by trial-and-error can be ruled out. The upcoming sections will suggest several approaches to deal with this problem.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0150"></a>[0150]</span>&#160;
		Another concern with the first implementation of section 4.1.5.2.1 is the fact that it only employs a two-dimensional structure. It is well known that nanopositioning works considerably better in two dimensions than in three. This is not to say that our approach, which would probably achieve a resolution between 0.1 and 1 <span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, could be endangered by current mass-manufacturing nanopositioning methods; this is not the case. Still, its prospects in the <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> long term would be enhanced if we could enforce a fraudster to reproduce a structure with an accuracy in the single-digit nanometer range <span style="font-style:italic">in three dimensions.</span> This was useful, in particular, for applications like the labeling of banknotes, since they require security over very long timescales and in the face of long-term technological progress.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0151"></a>[0151]</span>&#160;
		This brings us to some general issue which is important for our approach. When does a nanofabrication method pose a threat to our method? Only if it is capable to reproduce unique objects with the precision required to fool the employed measurement method, and, at the same time, operates at costs per object that are below the expected profits that result from faking. Thus, one needs to look for a mass-manufacturing method, not so much for very laborious sequential methods. As an example, take an AFM: It is conceivable that this technique can reproduce the distance between one donor--acceptor pair with the required precision. However, this method is simply to expensive, and there is also little trade off if one tries to reproduce the same structure more than once. Thus, current AFMs do not pose a great threat to our approach. Since future versions may do, however, the use of three dimensional structures seems to be necessary for ultra long-term security.<br clear="none"><br>

		Having found that our first implementation attempt was insecure in a number of respects, we will now discuss some possible countermeasures. The structure of section 4 mirrors the structure of section 4.1.5.3, as each of its subsections fixes one of the security problem posed in the subsections 4.1.5.3.1 to 4.1.5.3.3, respectively.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0153"></a>[0153]</span>&#160;
		The energy transfer between two particles works according to the following scheme: If the donor is excited through capturing a photon, it may relax through either irradiating a photon itself, dissipating the energy through heat (not irradiating a photon at all), or passing on the energy to the acceptor. Thus, on the observation of an energy transfer between two particles, one will never detect two photons emitted by the two different particles <span style="font-style:italic">simultaneously.</span> This distinguishes am energy transferring structure from the faking structure of section 3.1, where the dyes will absorb and emit photons independently. This fact could be exploited to distinguish the original structure from a dye-based fake. To that aim, one measures the cross-correlation of the transfer between the different dots in the nanocomplex, thereby determining a strict sequential order on the dot illumination: Dot 1 always emits before dot 2 before dot 3 etc.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0154"></a>[0154]</span>&#160;
		This provides an observer with a very strong indication that the two quantum dots are somehow coupled to each other, and that energy transfer occurs in the described circumstances. It should thus supplement our earlier measurement methods in order to maintain security.<br clear="none"><br>

		As discussed at the end of section 4.1.5.3.2, it seems necessary to increase the intricacy of the nanocomplexes in order to prevent trial-and-error reproduction and subsequent micrositioning. To that aim, one may apply the following measure: Instead of using a structure of only one donor that transfers its energy to only one acceptor in each <span style="font-style:italic">unit cell</span>, one can set up a sequence of quantum dots, all consecutively linked to a DNA strand, in which dot 1 transfers to dot 2, dot 2 to dot 3, and so on. If our measurement accuracy allows us to distinguish between <span style="font-style:italic">m</span> different distance values between neighbouring dots <span style="font-style:italic">i</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">j</span> , and if there are <span style="font-style:italic">n</span> dots attached in sequence, then there are <span style="font-style:italic">m</span><sup><span style="font-style:italic">n</span>-1</sup> distinguishable possibilities for the mutual distances of the particles in the whole nanocomplex (assuming that the distances are all independent). This means that the complexity increases exponentially with the number of quantum dots in the sequence.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0156"></a>[0156]</span>&#160;
		Some further care must be taken when choosing the measurement methods to observe the structure, however. The suggestive procedure would be to excite the structure with the frequency of dot 1, observe the transfer to dot 2, then excite dot 2 and watch the transfer to dot 3, etc. This is faulty, since it does not guarantee that the dots really form a consecutive sequence. Some thought shows that this signal can be imitated by pairs of donors and acceptors, or, putting this differently, that this measurement strategy is unable to distinguish between a long, consecutive sequence and many single pairs of donors and acceptors. Some further thought will reveal that the picture changes when one observes the transfer from dot 1 to dot 2, but also from dot 1 to dot 3 via dot 2 in a first step, then from dot 2 to dot 3 and from dot 2 to dot 4 via dot 3 in a second step, and so on. Combining this with the observation of the anti-bunching effect should lead to a secure unique object.<br clear="none"><br>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0157"></a>[0157]</span>&#160;
		Let us take our approach yet another step further. As discussed in section 4.1.5.3.3, it was preferable if a fraudster could be forced to produce or reproduce, respectively, a three-dimensional structure in order to imitate the measurement signal of the original. However, for practicality reasons all that we wanted to observe were relative intensities. How can we enforce the fraudster to go three-dimensional under these restrictions? Let us illustrate the essence of the problem by an example: Suppose that you measured a structure with 3 quantum dots A, B and C, and that you obtained transfer intensities that allowed you to conclude that the mutual distances were <span style="font-style:italic">AB</span> = 5.1<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AC =</span> 4.9<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">BC</span> = 5.2<span style="font-style:italic">nm.</span> In other words, A, B and C almost form an equilateral triangle. In that situation, the precise three-dimensional position of the triangle in the polymer matrix may be quite delicate and impossible to reproduce for the fraudster. Nevertheless, it is useless for our purpose, because it does not influence our measurement data, and thus cannot be inferred from it.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0158"></a>[0158]</span>&#160;
		Hence, the fraudster does not need to care about the triangles's three dimensional position in the matrix. In order to imitate the desired signal, it suffices if he merely employs a two-dimensional manufacturing process, by which he can create a triangle with the given sidelengths in the plane. In principle, such a two-dimensional manufacturing technique exists already, namely an AFM (but it is prohibitively expensive to use in our context; see also the discussion at the end of section 4.1.5.3.3).<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0159"></a>[0159]</span>&#160;
		Now consider the following, altered situation: Suppose that you observed a structure with 4 quantum dots A, B, C, and D, and obtained the following mutual distances:
<p class="dec novs">
<span style="font-style:italic">AB =</span> 5.1<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AC</span> = 4.9<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">AD</span> = 5.0<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>,<span style="font-style:italic">BC =</span> 5.1<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">BD</span> = 5.2<span style="font-style:italic">nm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">CD</span> = 5.0<span style="font-style:italic">nm.</span> In other words: The dots form an almost equilateral pyramid! This structure cannot be imitated by arranging nanoparticles in two dimensions, because one can prove mathematically that it is impossible to arrange four particles with basically equal pairwise distances in the plane.</p>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0160"></a>[0160]</span>&#160;
		Thus, in order to imitate the measurement data, the fraudster is <span style="font-style:italic">enforced</span> to reproduce a structure in three dimensions, which is just what we desired. Other geometrical shapes than pyramids which enforce three dimensional positioning are also conceivable.<br clear="none"><br>
In order to generate such arrangements of the quantum dots in practice, one might couple them to a pyramidally shaped chemical molecule. The bondings should have some, but not too much variation; may be some intermediate structure that induces the length variance on the right scales would be useful. The implementation details would be subject to further research, but the general idea overall seems very feasible.<br clear="none"><br>

		We have discussed one advantageous practical implementation of unique objects. The basic idea was to beat the diffraction limit by observing the energy transfer between particles, which allows a structural resolution on the order of nanometers. Our further analysis revealed, however, that in order to realise this idea securely in practice, additional concepts are required. The concepts that we suggested included using particle sequences and measuring anti-bunching effects or cross-correlations, respectively. These measures, as well as the other measures of section 4.1.5.5, are mainly directed towards two goals: Increasing the intricacy of the observed nanocomplexes on the one hand, and ensuring that the observed relative intensities really stem from an energy transfer (and not from other effects) on the other hand.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0165"></a>[0165]</span>&#160;
		A very useful further concept, which can enhance security against technological progress in the very long term, was to use three-dimensional geometrical structures which cannot be realised in the plane. This enforces a fraudster to execute nanoscale fabrication in three dimensions, which is considerably more difficult. By the concepts we described in section 4.1.5.4.3, we may conclude about the three-dimensionality of the observed structure even if we observe only relative intensities. In comparison with other optical approaches that implement unique objects [5], our concepts have the following advantages: Firstly, they achieve a spatial resolution that is higher by three or four orders of magnitude. Secondly, they do not require that a laser beam or another exciting signal is moved across the structure with very high precision, which is difficult to implement error-free in practice.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0166"></a>[0166]</span>&#160;

		A photonic crystal is a periodic arrangement of materials with different refractive indexes. Similar to semiconductor physics where the periodic electronic potential of the atoms lead to an electronic band structure for the electrons with bands and thus allowed and forbidden energy ranges for electrons, the periodic varying refractive index leads to a band structure for photons, where in certain geometries photonic band gaps arise. This means that a photonic crystal can be build in such a way that photons of a certain wavelength are not able to propagate within the photonic crystal.<br clear="none"><br>

		Optical resonators formed by introducing defects into two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs are capable of localizing light and can exhibit ultra high finesse optical modes. Due to the unavoidable disorder that arises during the fabrication of 2D photonic crystal membranes (electron beam lithography, reactive ion etching, HF etching), many features of the optical mode spectrum vary inevitably between any two, nominally identical, objects. These fluctuations can provide a unique and difficult-to-reproduce fingerprint.<br clear="none"><br>

		To enhance the complexity, one could not use only one cavity but an array of cavities. If the distance between the cavities is large they do not couple and the complexity of the object is only linearly increased. If the distance of the cavities is however small enough coupling between the cavities occur, which means that the properties of one cavity influences the properties of the surrounding cavities. This is particularly useful for our purpose, since it means that many -- or ideally all microcavities -- interact in the generation of the spectrum and the optical modes and/or resonant optical modes. This can be further fostered by special geometries for the interconnection of the coupled cavities. For example, the cavities can be placed along a waveguide structure, or connected via a waveguide- like structure; such types of structures are depicted, for example, in [98], Figure 1(a), 1(b), 1(c). As shown in [98], such structures can exhibit a very high amount of sharp and clearly distinguishable modes, which makes them especially suitable for our purpose. See also [98] as a general reference for coupling or microcavities, and the references given therein.<br clear="none"><br>

		One potentially advantageous implementation of unique objects are optical resonators or, more specifically, optical microcavities. These are optical objects which can confine lightwaves for comparably long timescales. During confinement, the lightwaves interact very strongly with the cavity surroundings, and the cavity finestructure imprints itself into the characteristics of the lightwaves. When the lightwaves later leave the cavity, their characteristics can act as a unique fingerprint of the unique finestructure of the cavity. This optical fingerprint can be measured more conveniently than the material finestructure of the cavity itself. Please note in this context that due to the microscale size of the microcavity, it is impossible to control the disorder during fabrication, whence no two microcavities have or can be produced to have the same finestructure.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0173"></a>[0173]</span>&#160;
		One particularly promising candidate for our purposes are photonic crystal microcavities with quantum dot emitters. Using quantum dots as emitters have the additional advantage that they make it easier to excite the cavity, and that they introduce further unique characteristics to the overall object through their unique emissive behavior.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0174"></a>[0174]</span>&#160;
		We will lead the subsequent discussion for photonic crystal microcavities, but would like to stress that similar considerations apply to all types of microcavities or optical resonators. For example, optical monolithic microresonators can be used to generate frequency combs, as has been shown in [23]; see also the references quoted therein. The large number of distinctive modes, whose precise frequencies inherently depend on the finestructure of the microresonator, makes these structures and their mode spectrum very well suited for our purposes, too. Just as with photonic crystals, it is conceivable not only to use the mode frequencies, but also time dependent characteristics, Q-factors or mode width, respectively, or the dependency of these values on the excitation signal or other features of the whole spectrum. Other types of microresonators that could be useful for our purpose, too, include microtoroids, microdisks or microspheres.<br clear="none"><br>

		What would happen if technological breakthroughs at some point could help to significantly reduce or even to control the disorder in the production of photonic crystal microcavities? There are two readily available and easily implementable countermeasures to resolve the situation.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0181"></a>[0181]</span>&#160;
		1. First of all, we do not need to use the hypothetical new technology for photonic crystal production, but may employ techniques specifically designed to induce particularly strong and irregular types of disorder. This strategy is illustrated by Figure 15, which opposes the disorder resulting from optimized and non-optimized production processes. The imperfections arising from non-optimized processes are apparently more discriminative and will be significantly harder to rebuild. Figure 15 shows side views on photonic crystal structures 151 to 153. The phototonic crystal structures 151 and 153 are fabricated by non-optimized production processes whereas the photonic crystal structure 152 is processed by an optimized production process. Disorder occurs in all three photonic crystal structures 151 to 153 but the imperfections in the photonic crystal structures 151 and 153 will be harder to rebuild.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0182"></a>[0182]</span>&#160;
		In fact, intentionally bad production techniques could already today be used advantageously to render refabrication more difficult.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0183"></a>[0183]</span>&#160;
		2. The used microcavities can also be made smaller. One interesting property is that their general features scale very well with their size. Phenomena like their reflective properties and the occurrence of cavity modes are preserved if the whole structure is shrinked within reasonable limits by a constant factor. All that changes is the lightwave regime in which these phenomena occur. The upside of this approach is that smaller structures are more sensitive to finer types of disorder. This enables us to adjust the structural size of the crystals in order to live right on the edge of current nanofabrication methods, and to thereby maintain their suitability as unique objects over long time periods. This technique can in principle be applied until the gap between pick-and-place and coarser techniques fully closes, which seems a very long way ahead.<br clear="none"><br>

		Photonic crystals can readily be mass fabricated using novel nano-structuring processes such as nanoimprint lithography, which is schematically illustrated in Figure 16.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0186"></a>[0186]</span>&#160;
		The technique illustrated in Figure 16 uses a prefabricated stamp 161 to define structures in a thermosensitive polymer 162 deposited on a substrate 163. A first process step 164 involves direct stamping of the stamp 161 into the thermosensitve polymer and subsequent cooling of the polymer 162. In a second process step 165, the stamp 161 is removed, revealing a copy of the stamp 161 in the polymer material 162. In a third method step 166, subsequent processing steps, for instance reactive ion beam etching (= RIE) and pattern transfer, can be used to copy this pattern into the underlying semiconductor material.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0187"></a>[0187]</span>&#160;
		At first sight it might seem that such parallel nanostructuring approaches would provide the faker an ideal tool to mass produce identical photonic structures. However, already during the stamping process inevitable irregularities occur. Furthermore, all subsequent nanofabrication steps, such as the aforementioned RIE, will unavoidably introduce additional disorder, which yields unique structures. Due to these properties nanoimprint lithography provides an ideal method to mass produce nanoscale unique photonic materials cost and time effectively.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0188"></a>[0188]</span>&#160;
		Another way to use the nanoimprint technology is to directly imprint a photonic crystal microcavity in a mold made of organic or inorganic nanoparticles. During the printing process the nanoparticles arrange in a unique way, which can result in unique optical properties of the crystal. For instance, nanoimprinted Silicon nanocrystals with a line spacing of about 200 nm may result in an unique structure. With an appropriate stamp advanced structures of e.g. nanoimprinted Silicon nanocrystals for photonic crystals or photonic crystal microcavities can be fabricated.<br clear="none"><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0189"></a>[0189]</span>&#160;
		To further enhance the non-reproducible irregularities, different nanoparticles can be used for one photonic crystal. And to alter the optical properties fluorescent nanocrystals could be built in such nanoimprinted or nanoembossed structures. Even a polymer, which acts as a host matrix for fluorescent or non-fluorescent nanoparticles, can be imprinted and used as a photonic crystal.<br clear="none"><br>

		Another approach to fabricate 3-dimensional photonic crystals or 3D photonic crystal cavities on large scales and cost efficiently could consist of using self-assembled structures made of block copolymers. Figure 17 shows different periodic structures made of block copolymers by varying the ratio of the molecules (taken from [32]). These structures can be used as photonic crystals if suitable polymers in the right ratio are used. By attaching nanoparticles on block copolymers, one can build up hybrid polymer-nanoparticle networks. After an annealing step the polymer can be removed from the structures and a stable network made of nanoparticles remains, which could be used as a photonic crystal. During the self-assembly process defects will arise, depending on the impurities and the process parameters, which are useful for the uniqueness of the photonic crystals.<br clear="none"><br>

		In order to stabilize the optical properties of the photonic crystals they have to be passivated to prevent oxidation, infiltration with airbourne pollutants and damage to their structural integrity. These problems can be circumvented by encapsulating the photonic nanostructure using optically inert polymer or plastics. Such techniques are commonly used for a wide range of optoelectronic devices and have, already over a decade ago, been applied to photonic crystal semiconductor lasers. An example of such passivation approaches is presented in Figure 18 that shows a schematic image of a photonic crystal nano laser 181, in which the air holes have been plugged with an optically inert polymer 182 to successfully prevent degredation. Unique photonic structures can be readily passivated using similar techniques. Their optical functionality and unique properties will then remain stable in environmental conditions, a key fact for successful practical applicability. The photonic crystal structure can be encapsulated by encapsulation caps 183 or by using nano-particles 184 that cover the holes 185.<br clear="none"><br>

		In order to readily probe the optical information from the photonic crystal, a measurement technique that combines high spatial and spectral resolution is required. Whilst high spectral resolution can be easily attained using an inexpensive prism monochromator coupled to a multichannel CCD detector, high spatial resolution will be achieved using a metal shadow mask on the sample surface. Such techniques are commonly applied in systems where optical measurements are performed in transmission geometry. They consist of depositing a opaque metal mask on the photonic crystal surface with an aperture in the vicinity of the photonic crystal nanocavity. Light incident from the upper side of the system is transmitted only through the optically relevant region of the object and the spectral properties can, therefore, be easily recovered.<br clear="none"><br>

		A further possible embodiment of unique objects consists in lasing action in a disordered medium with optical gain (powders forming disordered clusters of nanocrystals, colloidal suspensions, thin polymer films, etc.), commonly referred to as random lasing. For strong scattering, the light may backscatter to its original position, providing coherent feedback which serves as a local laser resonator in the disordered media. Such a object contains information in the form of the properties of the scatterers and thus the associated local random lasing paths, involving position, spectral and directional properties, time dependent optical behavior (e.g. decay times). In addition all of the above properties of a given local lasing path can be influenced by interaction with one or more of the other lasing paths in the object. Furthermore, the optical properties of the object can be influenced reversibly or irreversibly by external parameters such as temperature or pumping light intensity.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0195"></a>[0195]</span>&#160;

		The physical principle of random lasers lies in the combination of optical gain and random scattering in the disordered material, giving rise to the formation of local looped random lasing paths. For weak scattering, the optical propagation corresponds to a normal diffusion, leading to nonresonant feedback. For strong scattering, the light waves are trapped by multiple light scattering processes, leading to Anderson localization of light and coherent or resonant feedback in the laser medium [24]. The basic physical quantity to be detected is the spatially resolved (point of origin on the surface and spatial angles of the response) optical response to a continuous wave optical excitation or short laser pulses with different frequencies, intensities, duration, coordinates of incidence, laser spot diameter and shape, and direction of the laser beam. This optical response contains the individual spectral characteristics of each local lasing path, directional properties, the intensity or quantum efficiency, saturation effects, decay times, polarization, and temperature. All of these properties in principle will be influenced by spatial correlations between different lasing paths which depend strongly on the spatial overlap of those as well as on their individual optical properties, their position and orientation and the properties of the medium.<br clear="none"><br>

		One example of very compact random lasers (diameter about 1.7 &#181;m) are disordered grains of zinc oxide, acting as gain medium and scatterers at the same time and operating around 380 nm at room temperature [25]. Here, ZnO powder is used as the starting material, and the nanoparticles are synthesized with a so-called precipitation reaction to form a cluster consisting of about 20000 ZnO nanocrystallites. With fabrication costs of much less than one cent [26], these devices are very suitable for mass production. The specific emission frequency, which depends on size and shape, makes the device suitable for encoded marking of materials and documents [26]. Random lasing in these clusters is assumed to be based on additional feedback from the grain surfaces rather than Anderson localization [26]. Physical variables are the size and shape of the cluster as well as the size, shape, position and orientation of the individual crystallites.<br clear="none"><br>

		Let us now argue in favor of the security of the suggested implementations of unique objects with respect to the following essential aspects.
<ol><li style="position:relative">1. Uniqueness in the production process: The nature of the manufacturing process guarantees that it is highly unlikely that two objects are produced that exhibit the same properties with respect to a given measurement protocol. The realization schemes described above rely on nondeterministic preparation methods such as mixing, coagulation, formation of particle clusters, random disuniformities in the material. Depending on the sensitivity of the envisaged detection system, the preparation conditions can be tailored in such a way that the probability of undistinguishable objects can be made very small. In this context, we note that random lasers with resonant feedback provide more distinct spectral features in the lasing spectrum, and thus have more unique spectral characteristics than those with nonresonant feedback.</li><li style="position:relative">2. Non-Copyability: It is hard for a counterfeiter to copy the unique object. Random lasers are systems with intentionally introduced scattering centers or natural disuniformities like defects, whose optical properties depend strongly on the relative distance, orientation and shape of the scatterers. Especially in random lasers with resonant feedback, this provides sensitivity to distance variations on the Angstrom scale, even if the spatial resolution of the detection system (e.g. of a CCD-camera) is much lower (since distance and spatial correlation information is transformed into spectral information and furthermore angular, temporal or intensity information). Hence, in order to copy such a object, the faker would have to assemble a macroscopic system containing a large number of optically active particles with atomic precision. These difficulties persist even if only a few properties of the macroscopic system are measured. A further complication consists in the fact that external parameters might be used in the measurement process. Hence not only the spatial position but also other parameters such as orientation and further properties of the scattering centers have to be imitated by the fraudster.</li><li style="position:relative">3.

No Mimic or Imitation Systems: The proposed object relies solely on optical emission in a limited spectral range. It does not require an external power supply other than the purely optical excitation signal external and does not need the capability for electrical data processing or transfer. A mimic system would require a photonic synthesizer, which could generate deliberate photonic patterns in reaction to the possibly varying external excitation conditions. This obviously would require active optical elements (e.g. LED arrays), an internal power supply or an antenna, and electrical data processing capabilities (e.g. driver circuits). These components can be distinguished and detected from a purely optical system by conventional spectroscopic means, and in many cases will be distinguishable from the original structures through their slower response time.</li></ol>

		Optical storage media like CDs or DVDs can be combined very well with the approaches that we have described so far. In principle, most of the discussed unique structures can be distributed randomly over a CD or DVD during the production process, which introduces unique characteristics to the storage medium. Since the read out process of these optical storage media works by laser beam and detection of the scattered or reflected signal anyway, the design of a CD or DVD player is in principle well suited to read out the analog unique effects that, for example, randomly distributed nanonparticles on the CD or DVD surface would cause.<br clear="none"><br>

		One possible embodiment of electrical unique objects consists of a random distribution of electrically active junctions in form of a thin film integrated electronic device. Such a system would contain information in the form of individual current-voltage characteristics of a large number of interacting electronic junctions. A preferred property of such junctions is a strongly non-linear current-voltage behavior such as for a p-n-diode or a Schottky diode. In addition all of the above properties of a given junction can be influenced significantly by external illumination, external magnetic or electrical fields and/or temperature. A further preferred property of the junctions consists in the fact that their behavior is mutually dependent on the behavior of one or more other junctions.<br clear="none"><br>

		The physical principle behind the object as described above lies in the strong dependence of miniaturized electric semiconductor heterojunctions on physical parameters such as doping, temperature, area, defects, interface states and the applied bias. The basic physical quantity to be detected is the current across a given junction for a particular set of bias voltages applied to that junction or to other junctions interacting with that given junction. Contrary to the usual aim of integrated circuit design to produce reproducible devices which exhibit minimized manufacturing fluctuations in their electronic behavior, the present system of junctions can be produced in such a way as to purposely increase the device to device fluctuations to a level that makes the inter device difference conveniently measurable.<br clear="none"><br>

		One embodiment which can be realized with inexpensive starting material and which would hence be suitable for mass production consists of a matrix of silicon-based p-n- or Schottky-diodes produced on a glass substrate by laterally inhomogeneous deposition techniques. This inhomogeneity is important to guarantee the desired significant junction to junction variations. Such a suitable deposition technique is the laser induced, thermal or metal catalyzed crystallization of thin amorphous or nanocrystalline precursor films of silicon, silicon-germanium, etc. Here the statistical nature of nucleation and growth of individual crystallites is of primary importance for the complexity and/or the unique properties of the object. With the help of suitable metal electrode arrays of desired area and pitch electrical contact can be made to individual or multiple crystallites in the form of a sandwich geometry. The electrical contact can either be Ohmic or of Schottky type, depending on the electrode metals and/or the doping properties of the thin semiconductor film. Moreover, in general non-linear interactions between neighboring junctions can be realized.<br clear="none"><br>

		However, the fact that design methods in the field of microelectronics are so advanced poses a great challenge to the design of electrical unique objects. With state-of-the art digital and mixed-signal circuit design technology, it is possible to design a circuit that can synthesize basically any analog / digital waveform as a response to a given excitation. In fact, there are even well-established, systematic techniques for this task. A faker can always use these methods to build a circuit that is indistinguishable (by electrical measurements) from the original electrical unique object, simply because it reproduces the output signal of the original object.<br clear="none"><br>

Inexpensive electrical interfaces will always introduce noise, parasitic resistances and unwanted capacitances. Varying ambient conditions and the need to use low-cost read-out apparatus will further limit the accuracy, frequency or repeatability of the measurements.

		We propose an electro-optical unique object, which unifies the benefits of electrical and optical systems. It operates at the speed limits of current technology, but can nevertheless be read out with inexpensive machinery. In order to achieve these features, the object is excited by multiple, ultrafast laser pulses, but read-out electrically. The ultrafast excitation plus the unique circuit characteristics determine the circuit response, but this response can be read-out slowly and without the need for high accuracy; the response could even be read out as a single bit value. It is determined by the complex, ultra-fast internal dynamics of the (passive) circuit elements.<br clear="none"><br>

The photodiodes 202 are connected to capacitances 204 that can be read out by charge measurement circuit 205. The charge measurement circuit may be constructed similar to circuits used for reading out DRAMs. The charge measurement circuit 205 may finally be read out by contacts 206 which can also be used for applying a bias voltage to the photodiodes 202.<br clear="none"><br>

<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0220"></a>[0220]</span>&#160;
		The circuit is characterized by the function that maps the challenge C(&#964;,&#948;,V) to the response Q, i.e. the set of output charges. The function should be non-invertible in the sense that it is not a one-to-one (a.k.a. injective) function. The response Q, obviously, cannot be a simple integral of the photon flux, but must be sensitive to the relative timings of the input photon beams.

		The security of the system rests on the fact that any intelligent circuitry set up by a faker would work slower than the original system, and could not resolve the applied sequence of ultra-fast laser pulses. For this reason, it cannot distinguish between different sequences of pulses that are used as input signals to the system, and hence cannot return the correct outputs, even if it had a look-up table with all correct output values. On the other hand, if the faker uses the same type of diode network in an imitation system, he could not exactly reproduce the original network.

		A lower-security unique circuit, operating purely in the electrical regime, can be built from a small network of diodes. Figure 21 shows a purely electrical unique object 1 that comprises a passive network 211.

<p class="dec novs">Synthesizing the signals requires a larger-size circuit, which has to be fabricated or at least programmed for each particular unique object 1. It probably requires external power supply, dissipates high power, and could be bulky. These facts make its detection possible.</p>
<p class="dec novs">Alternatively the faker may be able to assemble a unique object from diodes and other compounds that is indistinguishable from the original (as far as the input-output relation is concerned), but it requires considerable effort and should be re-done for each particular object.

		In the first case the passive microwave scatterer produces a complicated and unique response to a high-frequency AC excitation. The operation is similar to the device of [41], with the significant differences that our object contains nonlinear elements (such as diodes / thresholding devices, possibly transistors), and that our object can be read out via electrical contacts. By applying a DC voltage on the circuit and setting an operating point, the same circuit can give a variety of AC responses. This can be used to (i) increase the information content of the circuit (ii) increase the compactness / reduce the size of the circuit (iii) make re-fabrication or imitation by passive elements more difficult. Diode-based passive circuits has a practically unlimited operation frequency (practically they certainly work in the several 100 GHz range), making digital synthesis impossible.<br clear="none"><br>

		Ultra-fast phenomena are in principle very well suited to create long-term secure unique objects, since they operate at the edge of technological and fundamental physical limits. It is known that they could be well generated and exploited inside closed chip environments; one potential problem is that electrical interfaces to the outside world could eat up the complexity and uniqueness of the output signals. Our central idea to solve this issue is to shift the need for ultra-high precision (in that case, ultra-high time resolutions) to the input signal and into the realm of optics. The creation of optical pulses with very high time resolution is standard technology, and the transfer of these pulses through air is not affected by strong disturbance effects. The output procedure can subsequently be done electrically, and with much lower accuracy and low time resolution. Ultimately even a one-bit output signal would suffice.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0230"></a>[0230]</span>&#160;
		Specifically, we suggested a unique object based on ultrafast photodetectors, which is sensitive to the timing of some exciting laser pulses, but does not require fast read-out circuitry. The device speed is limited by fundamental material constants (generation rates, mobilities, etc), which are intrinsically difficult to overcome for fundamental reasons, and not just because of practical obstacles. This provides the aspired long-term security of our structures against intelligent imitation or simple reproduction of the object.<br clear="none"><br>

		As a variation, it is possible to regenerate an optical signal from the output of the diode network, providing the whole system with both optical input and optical output signals. Besides the above highly-secure electrical - optical system we proposed a lower-security, purely electrical diode network, which produces different harmonics at different biasing points. Faking this extremely cheap circuit would require high-frequency signal generation or a tedious trial and error based refabrication process.<br clear="none"><br>

		Another embodiment consists of a remotely readable device based on surface acoustic wave technology as shown in Figure 22. A suitable transducer 221 transforms an external electromagnetic signal into a surface acoustic wave which travels across a substrate 222. On the substrate 222 a very complex, random and unique pattern of reflectors 223 (metal coatings or etched holes) has been created by suitable lithographic techniques or by printing. The reflections from each reflector 223 interfere with each other and form a unique wave pattern traveling back to the transducer 221. There the reflected wave pattern is transformed into a corresponding unique electromagnetic wave, which in turn can be detected by a suitable detection device. A further extension of the described approach would consist of a device with more than one transducer, which could detect the wave pattern simultaneously at different locations of the substrate and could emit in different external directions. This would be a way to prevent mimicking of the signal or the response, respectively, from a remote source by using advanced transmission techniques. Nearfield triangulation of the device by a suitable antenna array can be a further measure to detect the origin of the electromagnetic response signal in space and to prevent external mimicking.<br clear="none"><br>

The complexity and uniqueness comes from random interactions between a large number of random resonantors. It can be achieved by varying the key parameters of the resonantors (e.g. resonance frequency, damping and coupling to neighboring oscillators) through randomized production techniques (e.g. variation of resistance an/or resonance frequency by purposefully defective printing techniques).

		To provide a reproducible interrogation method, the radiating structures have to be insensitive to their relative position (within fabrication uncertainties) and the relative position to the interrogator (within reasonable limits). In other words, the radiating structures (i.e. scatterers or antennas) need to be well defined and reproducible. The non-reproducible differences have to be within the circuit itself.<br clear="none"><br>
    
<br clear="none"><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><a shape="rect" name="p0235"></a>[0235]</span>&#160;
		As radiating structures, standard well-defined planar antennas are used. These antennas are connected by some planar circuits, which contain non-linear components (diodes and/or transistors), transmission lines and couplers. Interrogation is done by irradiation of a single or multiple RF-signals at different amplitude (power density) levels. In the non-linear elements these signals are intermodulated and harmonics are generated. Especially at higher harmonics, the behavior of the passive structures depends critically on the actual dimensions of the metallization, the thickness and the permittivity of the substrate. The generation of harmonics and the intermodulation depend critically on the actual band gap, the quality of the Schottky-contact or the doping of the non-linear devices. Thus, the behavior of the circuit at higher harmonics is unique and non-reproducible. The interrogator measures the radiated intermodulation products or the fundamental frequency response. In order to become insensitive to the incident power (i.e. the distance between the interrogator and the <span class="highlightable highlight">RFID</span>), measurement is done at different power levels. This allows for a power calibration, i.e. the interrogator changes the incident power until it recognizes a known, pre-defined pattern of intermodulation products. Then the radiated intermodulation spectrum is measured for predefined power offsets and compared to the expected spectra.<br clear="none"><br>

		A general advantage of electrically addressable unique objects is the ease of the read-out procedure, which can occur either in direct electrical contact or remotely via electromagnetic waves. In both cases an advantage is the capability of shielding the unique object from the external environment by Faraday cage-like constructions containing the read-out system. This ensures that the detected signal indeed originates from the unique object. For remotely readable systems even triangulation of the position of the object would be possible with a suitable antenna array to again exclude external mimic attacks. Another advantage of some of the above embodiments is that the response can be probed over a wide range in frequency, thus further enhancing the uniqueness and the resistance of the objects against counterfeiting.<br clear="none"><br>

		It is conceivable to employ the described unique electrical structures in connection with standard electronic storage media in order to form unique electrical storage media. By the techniques described in section 3.2, digital content can be stored on such systems in a copy-protected form. Furthermore, copy-protected content can be generated and distributed "remotely" on such systems by the techniques of section 3.3.<br clear="none"><br>

		Our work contributes the following new aspects compared to the state of the art in the field:
<ul><li style="position:relative">It introduces one substantially new type of formal procedure/protocol, namely the remote generation of labels and the remote generation of copy-protected content. They are discussed in sections 2.4 and 3.3. These protocols allows the distribution of unforgeable labels or copy protected content over a binary data line (for example the internet), without physically transferring a unique object from location <span style="font-style:italic">A</span> to location <span style="font-style:italic">B</span>. This allows new applications, including new distribution structures and business models.</li><li style="position:relative">It describes a number of novel physical implementations of unique objects. Examples include the use of optical microcavitites and energy transfer between neighboring nanoparticles. Compared to other known approaches, for example that of [5], some of our suggestions realise a structural sensitivity that is higher by up to three decimal orders of magnitude, which dramatically enhances their security features against faking.</li><li style="position:relative">We also discuss a number of elect</li><li style="position:relative">For the first time, we present a formal definition and framework for the treatment of unique objects.</li></ul>
